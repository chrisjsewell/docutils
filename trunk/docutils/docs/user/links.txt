.. title:: Docutils Links

.. contents::

This document contains links users of Docutils and reStructuredText
may find useful, listed in no particular order.  Many of the project
listed here are hosted in the `Docutils Sandbox`_.  If you have
something to publish, you can get write access, too!

The most current version of this link list can always be found at
http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/links.html.


Users
-----

This section contains links which are interesting for all users of
Docutils.  All projects listed here are usable by end users in some
way, however please do not expect all of them to run straight out of
the box.

Editors
~~~~~~~

Editors with reStructuredText support and docutils GUIs:

* Emacs `rst mode <http://docutils.sf.net/docutils/tools/editors/emacs>`__.

* `reStructuredText syntax highlighting mode
  <http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=973>`__  for vim.

* `VST <http://skawina.eu.org/mikolaj/vst.html>`__ (Vim reStructured Text)
  is a plugin for Vim7 with folding.

* `rst mode <http://jedmodes.sf.net/mode/rst/>`__ for the 
  `JED <http://www.jedsoft.org/jed/>`__ programmers editor

* Gunnar Schwant's DocFactory_ is a wxPython GUI application for
  Docutils.

* ReSTedit_ by Bill Bumgarner is a Docutils GUI for Mac OS X.


Export 
~~~~~~

Convert reStructuredText to other formats:

PDF
"""

* `rst2pdf-pdflatex
  <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/sandbox/blais/rst2pdf/>`_ by Martin Blais
  is a minimal front end producing LaTeX, compiling the LaTeX file, getting
  the produced output to the destination location and finally deleting all
  the messy temporary files that this process generates.

* `rst2pdf-rubber <http://docutils.sf.net/sandbox/rst2pdf/README.html>`_ is
  a front end for the generation of PDF documents from a reStructuredText
  source via LaTeX in one step cleaning up intermediate files. It uses the
  `rubber <http://iml.univ-mrs.fr/~beffara/soft/rubber/>`_ Python wrapper
  for LaTeX and friends.
  
* `rst2pdf-reportlab <http://rst2pdf.googlecode.com>`_ is a tool to go 
  directly from restructured text to PDF, via `reportlab
  <http://www.reportlab.org/rl_toolkit.html>`_. No LaTeX installation is
  required.

* **py.rest** from the Codespeak `py Lib scripts`_ converts
  reStructuredText files to HTML and PDF (cleaning up the intermediate
  latex files).  Similar to ``buildhtml.py``, it looks recursively for
  .txt files in the given PATHS.

* The Docutils interface to PythonPoint_
  by Richard Jones produces PDF presentations using ReportLabs.

OpenOffice
""""""""""

* odtwriter_ the Open Document Format writer developed by Dave Kuhlman
  produces files that can be processed with OpenOffice and Abiword.

HTML variants
"""""""""""""

* rst2ht_ by Oliver Rutherfurd, converts reStructuredText to an .ht
  template, for use with ht2html_.

* htmlnav_ by Gunnar Schwant, is an HTML writer which supports navigation
  bars.

* rest2web_, by Michael Foord, is a tool for creating web sites with
  reStructuredText.

* rst2chm_ by Oliver Rutherfurd, generates Microsoft HTML Help files from
  reStructuredText files.

* `html4strict <http://docutils.sf.net/sandbox/html4strict/>`__
  produces XHTML that strictly conforms to the XHTML 1.0 specification.

* `html4trans <http://docutils.sf.net/sandbox/html4trans/>`__
  produces XHTML conforming to the version 1.0 Transitional DTD that
  contains enough formatting information to be viewed by a lightweight HTML
  browser without CSS support.

* A `simple HTML writer`_ by Bill Bumgarner that doesn't rely on CSS
  (stylesheets).

Others
""""""

* restxsl_ by Michael Alyn Miller, lets you transform reStructuredText
  documents into XML/XHTML files using XSLT stylesheets.

* An `XSLT script`_ by Ladislav Lhotka enables reStructuredText annotations
  to be included in RELAG NG XML schemas.

* `ManPage Writer`_ by Engelbert Gruber.
  
* `DocBook Writer`_ by Oliver Rutherfurd.


Import
~~~~~~

Convert other formats to reStructuredText:

* sxw2rest_, by Trent W. Buck, converts StarOffice XML Writer (SXW)
  files to reStructuredText.

* xml2rst_, an XSLT stylesheet written by Stefan Merten, converts XML
  dumps of the document tree (e.g. created with rst2xml.py) back to
  reStructuredText.

* xhtml2rest_, written by Antonios Christofides, is a simple utility
  to convert XHTML to reStructuredText.

Extensions
~~~~~~~~~~

Extend the reStructuredText syntax or the features of docutils.
More extensions are in the `Docutils Sandbox`_.

* Jens J. Mortensen developed `LaTeX math for reST`_, which writes to
  LaTeX or to MathML.

* Beni Cherniavsky has written a generic `preprocessing module`_ for
  roles and/or directives and built preprocessors for TeX math for
  both LaTeX and HTML output on top of it.


Related Applications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Applications using docutils/reStructuredText, helper applications:

* For Wikis, please see the `FAQ entry about Wikis`_.

* For Blogs (Weblogs), please see the `FAQ entry about Blogs`_.

* PyLit_ provides a bidirectional text <--> code converter for *literate
  programming with reStructuredText*.

* Pandoc_ is a document converter; it can read Markdown and (subsets
  of) reStructuredText, HTML, and LaTeX, and it can write Markdown,
  reStructuredText, HTML, LaTeX, RTF, DocBook XML, and S5.

* There is an `ASCII art to SVG converter`_ (aafigure), developed by
  Chris Liechti.

* ZReST_, by Richard Jones, is a "ReStructuredText Document for Zope"
  application that is complete and ready to install.

* Beni Cherniavsky maintains a Makefile_ for driving Docutils, hoping
  to handle everything one might do with Docutils.



API Developers
--------------

This section contains links which are primarily interesting for
developers who use the Docutils API from within their own
applications.

* Nabu_, written by Martin Blais, is a publishing system which
  extracts information from reStructuredText documents and stores it
  in a database.  Python knowledge is required to write extractor
  functions (see `Writing an Extractor`_) and to retrieve the data
  from the database again.

* There is a `pickle writer`_, written by Martin Blais.


Core Developers
---------------

Links primarily interesting for developers who work with the Docutils
code base.

* PySource_, by Tony Ibbs, is an experimental Python source Reader.
  There is some related code in David Goodger's sandbox
  (pysource_reader_) and a `Python Source Reader`_ document.
