.. title:: Docutils Links

.. contents::

This document contains links users of Docutils and reStructuredText
may find useful, listed in no particular order.  Many of the project
listed here are hosted in the `Docutils Sandbox`_.  If you have
something to publish, you can get write access, too!

The most current version of this link list can always be found at
http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/links.html.


Users
-----

This section contains links which are interesting for all users of
Docutils.  All projects listed here are usable by end users in some
way, however please do not expect all of them to run straight out of
the box.

* For Wikis, please see the `FAQ entry about Wikis`_.

* For Blogs (Weblogs), please see the `FAQ entry about Blogs`_.

* There is an `ASCII art to SVG converter`_ (aafigure), developed by
  Chris Liechti.

* Alberto Berti is developing an `OpenDocument writer`_.

* Jens J. Mortensen developed `LaTeX math for reST`_, which writes to
  LaTeX or to MathML.

* xml2rst_, an XSLT stylesheet written by Stefan Merten, converts XML
  dumps of the document tree (e.g. created with rst2xml.py) back to
  reStructuredText.

* xhtml2rest_, written by Antonios Christofides, is a simple utility
  to convert XHTML to reStructuredText.

* rst2ht_, by Oliver Rutherfurd, converts reStructuredText to an .ht
  template, for use with ht2html_.

* htmlnav_, by Gunnar Schwant, is an HTML writer which supports
  navigation bars.

* rst2chm_, written by Oliver Rutherfurd, generates Microsoft HTML
  Help files from reStructuredText files.

* rest2web_, by Michael Foord, is a tool for creating web sites with
  reStructuredText.

* ZReST_, by Richard Jones, is a "ReStructuredText Document for Zope"
  application that is complete and ready to install.

* The Docutils interface to PythonPoint_, also by Richard Jones,
  produces PDF presentations using ReportLabs.

* Engelbert Gruber has begun a `ManPage Writer`_.

* Oliver Rutherfurd has begun a `DocBook Writer`_.

* Gunnar Schwant's DocFactory_ is a wxPython GUI application for
  Docutils.

* Patrick O'Brien has taken over the `OpenOffice.org Writer`_.

* Bill Bumgarner has written a `simple HTML writer`_ that doesn't rely
  on CSS (stylesheets).

* Beni Cherniavsky has written a generic `preprocessing module`_ for
  roles and/or directives and built preprocessors for TeX math for
  both LaTeX and HTML output on top of it.

* Beni Cherniavsky maintains a Makefile_ for driving Docutils, hoping
  to handle everything one might do with Docutils.


API Developers
--------------

This section contains links which are primarily interesting for
developers who use the Docutils API from within their own
applications.

* Nabu_, written by Martin Blais, is a publishing system which
  extracts information from reStructuredText documents and stores it
  in a database.  Python knowledge is required to write extractor
  functions (see `Writing an Extractor`_) and to retrieve the data
  from the database again.

* There is a `pickle writer`_, written by Martin Blais.


Core Developers
---------------

Links primarily interesting for developers who work with the Docutils
code base.

* PySource_, by Tony Ibbs, is an experimental Python source Reader.
  There is some related code in David Goodger's sandbox
  (pysource_reader_) and a `Python Source Reader`_ document.
