This document describes the directives implemented in the reference
reStructuredText parser.

-------------
 Admonitions
-------------

DTD elements: attention, caution, danger, error, hint, important,
note, tip, warning.

Directive block: directive data and all following indented text
are interpreted as body elements.

Admonitions are specially marked "topics" that can appear anywhere an
ordinary body element can.  They contain arbitrary body elements.
Typically, an admonition is rendered as an offset block in a document,
sometimes outlined or shaded, with a title matching the admonition
type.  For example::

    .. DANGER::
       Beware killer rabbits!

This directive might be rendered something like this::

    +------------------------+
    |        !DANGER!        |
    |                        |
    | Beware killer rabbits! |
    +------------------------+

The following admonition directives have been implemented:

- attention
- caution
- danger
- error
- hint
- important
- note
- tip
- warning

Any text immediately following the directive indicator (on the same
line and/or indented on following lines) is interpreted as a directive
block and is parsed for normal body elements.  For example, the
following "note" admonition directive contains one paragraph and a
bullet list consisting of two list items::

    .. note:: This is a note admonition.
       This is the second line of the first paragraph.

       - The note contains all indented body elements
         following.
       - It includes this bullet list.


--------
 Images
--------

There are two image directives: "image" and "figure".


Image
=====

DTD element: image.

Directive block: directive data and following indented lines (up to
the first blank line) are interpreted as image URI and optional
attributes.

An "image" is a simple picture::

    .. image:: picture.png

The URI for the image source file is specified in the directive data.
As with hyperlink targets, the image URI may begin on the same line as
the explicit markup start and target name, or it may begin in an
indented text block immediately following, with no intervening blank
lines.  If there are multiple lines in the link block, they are
stripped of leading and trailing whitespace and joined together.

Optionally, the image link block may end with a flat field list, the
_`image attributes`.  For example::

    .. image:: picture.png
       :height: 100
       :width: 200
       :scale: 50
       :alt: alternate text

The following attributes are recognized:

``alt`` : text
    Alternate text: a short description of the image, displayed by
    applications that cannot display images, or spoken by applications
    for visually impaired users.
``height`` : integer
    The height of the image in pixels, used to reserve space or scale
    the image vertically.
``width`` : integer
    The width of the image in pixels, used to reserve space or scale
    the image horizontally.
``scale`` : integer
    The uniform scaling factor of the image, a percentage (but no "%"
    symbol is required or allowed).  "100" means full-size.


Figure
======

DTD elements: figure, image, caption, legend.

Directive block: directive data and all following indented text are
interpreted as an image URI, optional attributes, a caption, and an
optional legend.

A "figure" consists of image_ data (optionally including `image
attributes`_), an optional caption (a single paragraph), and an
optional legend (arbitrary body elements)::

    .. figure:: picture.png
       :scale: 50
       :alt: map to buried treasure

       This is the caption of the figure (a simple paragraph).

       The legend consists of all elements after the caption.  In this
       case, the legend consists of this paragraph and the following
       table:

       +-----------------------+-----------------------+
       | Symbol                | Meaning               |
       +=======================+=======================+
       | .. image:: tent.png   | Campground            |
       +-----------------------+-----------------------+
       | .. image:: waves.png  | Lake                  |
       +-----------------------+-----------------------+
       | .. image:: peak.png   | Mountain              |
       +-----------------------+-----------------------+

There must be a blank line before the caption paragraph and before the
legend.  To specify a legend without a caption, use an empty comment
("..") in place of the caption.

Table of Contents
=================

DTD elements: pending, topic.

Directive block: directive data and following indented lines (up to
the first blank line) are interpreted as the topic title and optional
attributes.

The "contents" directive inserts a table of contents (TOC) in two
passes: initial parse and transform.  During the initial parse, a
"pending" element is generated which acts as a placeholder, storing
the TOC title and any attributes internally.  At a later stage in the
processing, the "pending" element is replaced by a "topic" element, a
title and the table of contents proper.

The directive in its simplest form::

    .. contents::

Language-dependent boilerplate text will be used for the title.  The
English default title text is "Contents".

An explicit title, may be specified::

    .. contents:: Table of Contents

The title may span lines, although it is not recommended::

    .. contents:: Here's a very long Table of
       Contents title

Attributes may be specified for the directive, using a field list::

    .. contents:: Table of Contents
       :depth: 2

If the default title is to be used, the attribute field list may begin
on the same line as the directive marker::

    .. contents:: :depth: 2

The following attributes are recognized:

``depth`` : integer
    The number of section levels that are collected in the table of
    contents.
``local`` : empty
    Generate a local table of contents.  Entries will only include
    subsections of the section in which the directive is given.  If no
    explicit title is given, the table of contents will not be titled.

 HTML-Specific

Meta
====

Non-standard element: meta.

Directive block: directive data and following indented lines (up to
the first blank line) are parsed for a flat field list.

The "meta" directive is used to specify HTML metadata stored in HTML
META tags.  "Metadata" is data about data, in this case data about web
pages.  Metadata is used to describe and classify web pages in the
World Wide Web, in a form that is easy for search engines to extract
and collate.

Within the directive block, a flat field list provides the syntax for
metadata.  The field name becomes the contents of the "name" attribute
of the META tag, and the field body (interpreted as a single string
without inline markup) becomes the contents of the "content"
attribute.  For example::

    .. meta::
       :description: The reStructuredText plaintext markup language
       :keywords: plaintext, markup language

This would be converted to the following HTML::

    <meta name="description"
        content="The reStructuredText plaintext markup language">
    <meta name="keywords" content="plaintext, markup language">

Support for other META attributes ("http-equiv", "scheme", "lang",
"dir") are provided through field arguments, which must be of the form
"attr=value"::

    .. meta::
       :description lang=en: An amusing story
       :description lang=fr: Un histoire amusant

And their HTML equivalents::

    <meta name="description" lang="en" content="An amusing story">
    <meta name="description" lang="fr" content="Un histoire amusant">

Some META tags use an "http-equiv" attribute instead of the "name"
attribute.  To specify "http-equiv" META tags, simply omit the name::

    .. meta::
       :http-equiv=Content-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1

HTML equivalent::

    <meta http-equiv="Content-Type"
         content="text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1">


Imagemap
========

Non-standard element: imagemap.

 Miscellaneous

Raw Data Pass-Through
=====================

DTD element: pending.

Directive block: the directive data is interpreted as an output format
type, and all following indented text is stored verbatim,
uninterpreted.

The "raw" directive indicates non-reStructuredText data that is to be
passed untouched to the Writer.  The name of the output format is
given in the directive data.  During the initial parse, a "pending"
element is generated which acts as a placeholder, storing the format
and raw data internally.  The interpretation of the code is up to the
Writer.  A Writer may ignore any raw output not matching its format.

For example, the following input would be passed untouched by an HTML
Writer::

    .. raw:: html
       <hr width=50 size=10>

A LaTeX Writer could insert the following raw content into its
output stream::

    .. raw:: latex
       \documentclass[twocolumn]{article}


Restructuredtext-Test-Directive
===============================

DTD element: system_warning.

Directive block: directive data is stored, and all following indented
text is interpreted as a literal block.

This directive is provided for test purposes only.  (Nobody is
expected to type in a name *that* long!)  It is converted into a
level-1 (info) system message showing the directive data, possibly
followed by a literal block containing the rest of the directive
block.
