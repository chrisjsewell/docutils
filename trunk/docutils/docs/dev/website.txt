The Docutils web site, <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/>, is
maintained by the ``docutils-update.local`` script, run by project 
maintainers on their local machines.  The script
will process any .txt file which is newer than the corresponding .html
file in the project's web directory on shell.berlios.de
(``/home/groups/docutils/htdocs/aux/htdocs/``) and upload the changes
to the web site at SourceForge.

    The Docutils web site, <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/>, is
    maintained automatically by the ``docutils-update`` script, run as an
    hourly cron job on shell.berlios.de (by user "wiemann").  The script
    will process any .txt file which is newer than the corresponding .html
    file in the project's web directory on shell.berlios.de
    (``/home/groups/docutils/htdocs/aux/htdocs/``) and upload the changes
    to the web site at SourceForge.

Please **do not** add any generated .html files to the Docutils
repository.  They will be generated automatically after a one-time
setup (`described below`__).

__ `Adding .txt Files`_

The docutils-update.local__ script is located at
``sandbox/infrastructure/docutils-update.local``.

__ http://docutils.sf.net/sandbox/infrastructure/docutils-update.local

If you want to share files via the web, you can upload them using the
uploaddocutils.sh__ script
(``sandbox/infrastructure/uploaddocutils.sh``).

Setting Up
==========

(TBA)


.. .. not needed if one just adds the .html files to the list
      Only the maintainer has to keep this in mind (until the 
      update-htmlfiles script is incorporated into
      docutils-update.local)

  Adding Directories
  ==================

  After adding directories to SVN, allow the update script to run once
  to create the directories in the filesystem before preparing for HTML
  processing as described below.


Adding .txt Files
=================

When adding a new .txt file that should be converted to HTML:

* Edit sandbox/infrastructure/htmlfiles.lst, and add the .html file
  corresponding to the new .txt file (please keep the sorted order).

* Commit the edited version to the SVN repository.

.. .. instructions for the maintainer:

  Run the sandbox/infrastructure/update-htmlfiles shell script to
  generate .html files::

      cd <DOCUTILS-ROOT>/docutils/
      sandbox/infrastructure/update-htmlfiles sandbox/infrastructure/htmlfiles.lst

  Maybe this should become part of docutils-update.local.

..  .. old instructions, for cron job:

    For a new .txt file, just SSH to ``<username>@shell.berlios.de`` and
    ::

        cd /home/groups/docutils/htdocs/aux/htdocs/
        cd [path to your file's subdirectory]
        touch filename.html
        chmod g+w filename.html
        sleep 1
        touch filename.txt

    The script will take care of the rest within an hour.  Thereafter
    whenever the .txt file is modified (checked in to SVN), the .html will
    be regenerated automatically.


Removing Files & Directories
============================

Removing files and directories from SVN will not trigger their removal
from the web site.  Files and directories must be manually removed
from sourceforge.net
(under ``/home/groups/d/do/docutils/htdocs/``).  Also remove the files
from sandbox/infrastructure/htmlfiles.lst.
