Abstract
--------

This document documents trials to build python wheels from Docutils. Once it
is finished it might be driven into distribution or release documentation.

Requests
--------

There is `feature request 43`_ :  Make setup.py build wheels.

  Just add this to setup.cfg:

  [bdist_wheel]
  universal = 1


  .. warning:: Docutils is not fit for Universal Wheels. It supports both
     Python 2 and 3, but with different code (we use “2to3”). This makes it
     a candidate for `Pure Python wheels`_.

     As "universal" is false by default, no change to setup.cfg is required.
     The wheel builder detects that the package is pure Python and generates
     wheels for Py2 and Py3 depending under which python version it runs.

and bugs275_ : Upload wheels to pypi

  Currently docutils does not publish any wheels on pypi. Wheels make docutils
  faster to install (no need to run setup.py, which for a large number of
  packages can take some time), and is no more difficult than uploading an
  sdist (see https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/distributing.html#wheels
  for instructions).

Logbook
-------

1. Add ``[bdist_wheel] universal = 0`` to setup.cfg.
2. Run ``python setup.py bdist_wheel``::

     error: invalid command 'bdist_wheel'

3. setuptools is too old. Install the new one by wheel or source or pip or
   easy...

4. try wheel ... first get wheel tar.gz and unpack.

5. try ::

     python2.7 wheel-0.24.0/wheel install setuptools-15.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl

   no error. But still ``error: invalid command 'bdist_wheel'``::

     $ python2.7 setup.py --version
     0.12

   Did wheel install ? If no, why no error, if yes in which place ?


Logbook: with setuptools branch
-------------------------------

`gitpull/setuptools`_ sandbox branch introduces `setuptools`_ in ``setup.py``.

As of 2015-04-16: **Not working yet**, ``import docutils`` will raise an
``ImportError``. Need to get packages detected correctly.

Install::

    $ svn checkout svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/docutils/code/trunk/sandbox/gitpull/setuptools docutils-setuptools
    $ cd setuptools
    # create a virtualenv (however you like)
    $ pip install -e .

This includes support for generate ``python setup.py bdist_wheel``::

Logbook with "pip"
------------------

Docutils' "setup.py" imports from the stdlib's "distutils" module
instead of the 3rd party "setuptools". "distutils" cannot build wheels. [#]_

OTOH, pip_ internally uses "setuptools" instead of "distutils". This way, it
can generate wheels without changes to "setup.py".

1. Install "pip" and "wheels"

   Under Debian Gnu/Linux: ``aptitude install python-pip python3-pip``

2. In the repository root directory, run ::

      #> pip wheel ./docutils/
      Unpacking ./docutils
        Running setup.py (path:/tmp/pip-Ym9hKL-build/setup.py) egg_info for package from file:///[...]docutils-svn/docutils

          warning: no previously-included files matching '.DS_Store' found under directory '*'
      Building wheels for collected packages: docutils
        Running setup.py bdist_wheel for docutils
        Destination directory: /home/milde/Code/Python/docutils-svn/wheelhouse
      Successfully built docutils
      Cleaning up...

3. There is a "pure Python" wheel under
   ``wheelhouse/docutils-0.13-py2-none-any.whl``

4. Repeat with::

     #> pip3 wheel ./docutils/
     
   to get ``wheelhouse/docutils-0.13-py3-none-any.whl``

You can also generate wheels for Docutils 0.12 with ``pip wheel docutils``
and ``pip3 wheel docutils``. The 0.12 archive is downloaded from PIP and
re-packed as wheel. With "pip3" this includes the 2to3 conversion.

Summary:
  With the "pip" utility, it is possible to generate wheels for Python 2
  and 3 for both, the released and the repository version of Docutils
  without changes to the code base.

  The generated wheel can be installed. Installing the Py3k version happens
  "instantaneously".
