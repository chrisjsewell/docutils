Docutils uses a Subversion_ repository located at ``svn.berlios.de``.
Subversion is exhaustively documented in the `Subversion Book`_
(svnbook).

.. _Subversion: http://subversion.tigris.org/
.. _Subversion Book: http://svnbook.red-bean.com/

.. Note::

   While the repository resides at BerliOS, all other project data
   (web site, snapshots, releases, mailing lists, trackers) is hosted
   at SourceForge.

For the project policy on repository use (check-in requirements,
branching, etc.), please see the `Docutils Project Policies`__.

Accessing the Repository
========================

Web Access
----------

The repository can be browsed and examined via the web at
http://svn.berlios.de/viewcvs/docutils/.


Anonymous Access
----------------

Anonymous (read-only) access is available at ``svn://svn.berlios.de/docutils/``.

To check out the current main source tree of Docutils, type ::

    svn checkout svn://svn.berlios.de/docutils/trunk/docutils

To check out everything (main tree, sandboxes, and web site), type ::

    svn checkout svn://svn.berlios.de/docutils/trunk docutils

This will create a working copy of the whole trunk in a new directory
called ``docutils``.

If you cannot use the ``svn`` port, you can also use the HTTP access
method by substituting "http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos" for
"svn://svn.berlios.de".

Note that you should *not* check out ``svn://svn.berlios.de/docutils``
(without "trunk"), because then you'd end up fetching the whole
Docutils tree for every branch and tag over and over again, wasting
your and BerliOS's bandwidth.

To update your working copy later on, cd into the working copy and
type ::

    svn update


Workaround for Localized Dates
------------------------------

If you have a non-english locale, you should perform all check-out and update 
operations with ``LC_TIME=C`` in the environment.  Either set it in your shell 
init file, or (if you like localized dates in other programs) always do ::

    env LC_TIME=C svn checkout ...
    env LC_TIME=C svn update ...
    
This applies both to anonymous and developer access.

The reason is that subversion localizes its expansion of the ``Date``
keyword, which may result in non-ASCII characters in other locales.
Non-ASCII characters upset Python, even if they only appear in comments.
Adding an encoding declaration to all Python sources doesn't help because
the declaration would be a fixed part of the file, while the date encoding
could be different for every person checking out the code...

Arguably, the Right Thing would be for subversion to understand file
encodings: convert file contents, localize keywords and expand an Encoding
keyword to reflect the encoding used.  But for now, ``LC_TIME=C`` fixes this
by disabling the translation of the date (the current time zone is still
respected).


Developer Access
----------------

(Developers who had write-access for Docutils' CVS repository on
SourceForge.net should `register at BerliOS`__ and send a message with
their BerliOS user name to `Felix Wiemann <Felix.Wiemann@ososo.de>`_.)

__ https://developer.berlios.de/account/register.php

If you are a developer, you get read-write access via
``svn+ssh://<user>@svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/docutils/``, where
``<user>`` is your BerliOS user account name.  So to retrieve a
working copy, type ::

    svn checkout svn+ssh://<user>@svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/docutils/trunk \
        docutils

If you have a non-english locale, set ``LC_TIME=C`` as described above.

If you previously had an anonymous working copy and gained developer
access, you can switch the URL associated with your working copy with
this command (executed in the root of your working copy) ::

    svn switch --relocate svn://svn.berlios.de/docutils \
        svn+ssh://<user>@svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/docutils

(Again, ``<user>`` is your BerliOS user account name.)

If you cannot use the ``ssh`` port, you can also use the HTTPS access
method by substituting "https://svn.berlios.de" for
"svn+ssh://svn.berlios.de".


Setting Up Your Subversion Client For Development
`````````````````````````````````````````````````

Before commiting changes to the repository, please ensure that the
following lines are contained (and uncommented) in your
~/.subversion/config file, so that new files are added with the
correct properties set::

    [miscellany]
    # For your convenience:
    global-ignores = ... *.pyc ...
    # For correct properties:
    enable-auto-props = yes

    [auto-props]
    *.py = svn:eol-style=native;svn:keywords=Author Date Id Revision
    *.txt = svn:eol-style=native;svn:keywords=Author Date Id Revision
    *.html = svn:eol-style=native;svn:keywords=Author Date Id Revision
    *.xml = svn:eol-style=native;svn:keywords=Author Date Id Revision
    *.tex = svn:eol-style=native;svn:keywords=Author Date Id Revision
    *.css = svn:eol-style=native;svn:keywords=Author Date Id Revision
    *.patch = svn:eol-style=native
    *.sh = svn:eol-style=native;svn:executable;svn:keywords=Author Date Id Revision
    *.png = svn:mime-type=image/png
    *.jpg = svn:mime-type=image/jpeg
    *.gif = svn:mime-type=image/gif


Setting Up SSH Access
`````````````````````

With a public & private key pair, you can access the shell and
Subversion servers without having to enter your password.  There are
two places to add your SSH public key on BerliOS: your web account and
your shell account.

* Adding your SSH key to your BerliOS web account:

  1. Log in on the web at https://developer.berlios.de/.  Create your
     account first if necessary.  You should be taken to your "My
     Personal Page" (https://developer.berlios.de/my/).

  2. Choose "Account Options" from the menu below the top banner.

  3. At the bottom of the "Account Maintenance" page
     (https://developer.berlios.de/account/) you'll find a "Shell
     Account Information" section; click on "[Edit Keys]".

  4. Copy and paste your SSH public key into the edit box on this page
     (https://developer.berlios.de/account/editsshkeys.php).  Further
     instructions are available on this page.

* Adding your SSH key to your BerliOS shell account:

  1. Log in to the BerliOS shell server::

         ssh <user>@shell.berlios.de

     You'll be asked for your password, which you set when you created
     your account.

  2. Create a .ssh directory in your home directory, and remove
     permissions for group & other::

         mkdir .ssh
         chmod og-rwx .ssh

     Exit the SSH session.

  3. Copy your public key to the .ssh directory on BerliOS::

         scp .ssh/id_dsa.pub <user>@shell.berlios.de:.ssh/authorized_keys

  Now you should be able to start an SSH session without needing your
  password.


Repository Layout
=================

The following tree shows the repository layout::

    docutils/
    |-- branches/
    |   |-- branch1/
    |   |   |-- docutils/
    |   |   |-- sandbox/
    |   |   `-- web/
    |   `-- branch2/
    |       |-- docutils/
    |       |-- sandbox/
    |       `-- web/
    |-- tags/
    |   |-- tag1/
    |   |   |-- docutils/
    |   |   |-- sandbox/
    |   |   `-- web/
    |   `-- tag2/
    |       |-- docutils/
    |       |-- sandbox/
    |       `-- web/
    `-- trunk/
        |-- docutils/
        |-- sandbox/
        `-- web/

``docutils/branches/`` and ``docutils/tags/`` contain (shallow) copies
of the whole trunk.

The main source tree lives at ``docutils/trunk/docutils/``, next to
the sandboxes (``docutils/trunk/sandbox/``) and the web site files
(``docutils/trunk/web/``).
