To Do
=====

Priority items are marked with "@" symbols.  The more @s, the higher
the priority.

General
-------

- Document!

  - Internal module documentation.

  - User docs.

  - Doctree nodes (DTD element) semantics:

    - External (public) attributes (node.attributes).
    - Internal attributes (node.*).
    - Linking mechanism.

- Refactor

  - Rename methods & variables according to the `coding conventions`_
    below.

  - The name->id conversion and hyperlink resolution code needs to be
    checked for correctness and refactored.  I'm afraid it's a bit of
    a spaghetti mess now.

- Add validation?  See http://pytrex.sourceforge.net, RELAX NG.

- Ask Python-dev for opinions (GvR for a pronouncement) on special
  variables (__author__, __version__, etc.): convenience vs. namespace
  pollution.  Ask opinions on whether or not Docutils should recognize
  & use them.

- In reader.get_reader_class (& parser & writer too), should we be
  importing 'standalone' or 'docutils.readers.standalone'?  (This would
  avoid importing top-level modules if the module name is not in
  docutils/readers.  Potential nastiness.)

- Perhaps store a name->id mapping file?  This could be stored
  permanently, read by subsequent processing runs, and updated with
  new entries.  ("Persistent ID mapping"?)

- @@@ Implement a PEP reader.

- @@ Add support for character set encodings on input & output, Unicode
  internally.

  - Use an "encoding" directive, and/or an "encoding" field in field
    lists & PEP headers.  (The same could apply to "language".)
  - Need a Unicode -> HTML entities codec for HTML writer?


Specification
-------------

- Complete PEP 258 Docutils Design Specification.

  - Fill in the blanks in API details.

  - Specify the nodes.py internal data structure implementation.

        [Tibs:] Eventually we need to have direct documentation in
        there on how it all hangs together - the DTD is not enough
        (indeed, is it still meant to be correct?  [Yes, it is.]).

- Rework PEP 257, separating style from spec from tools, wrt Docutils?
  See Doc-SIG from 2001-06-19/20.

- Add layout component to framework?  Or part of the formatter?

- Once doctree.txt is fleshed out, how about breaking (most of) it up
  and putting it into nodes.py as docstrings?


reStructuredText Parser
-----------------------

- Add motivation sections for constructs in spec.

- Allow very long titles (on two or more lines)?

- And for the sake of completeness, should definition list terms be
  allowed to be very long (two or more lines) also?

- Support generic hyperlink references to targets in other documents?
  Not in an HTML-centric way, though (it's trivial to say
  ``http://www.whatever.com/doc#name``, and useless in non-HTML
  contexts).  XLink/XPointer?  ``.. baseref::``?  See Doc-SIG
  2001-08-10.

- Add character processing?  For example:

  - ``--`` -> em-dash (or ``--`` -> en-dash, and ``---`` -> em-dash).
    (Look for pre-existing conventions.)
  - Convert quotes to curly quote entities.  (Essentially impossible
    for HTML?  Unnecessary for TeX.  An output issue?)
  - Various forms of ``:-)`` to smiley icons.
  - ``"\ "`` -> &nbsp;.
  - Escaped newlines -> <BR>.
  - Escaped period or quote as a disappearing catalyst to allow
    character-level inline markup?
  - Others?

  How to represent character entities in the text though?  Probably as
  Unicode.

  Which component is responsible for this, the parser, the reader, or
  the writer?

- Implement the header row separator modification to table.el.  (Wrote
  to Takaaki Ota & the table.el mailing list on 2001-08-12, suggesting
  support for '=====' header rows.  On 2001-08-17 he replied, saying
  he'd put it on his to-do list, but "don't hold your breath".)

- Tony says inline markup rule 7 could do with a *little* more
  exposition in the spec, to make clear what is going on for people
  with head colds.

- Alan Jaffray suggested (and I agree) that it would be sensible to:

  - have a directive to specify a default role for interpreted text
  - allow the reST processor to take an argument for the default role
  - issue a warning when processing documents with no default role
    which contain interpreted text with no explicitly specified role

- Fix the parser's indentation handling to conform with the stricter
  definition in the spec.  (Explicit markup blocks should be strict or
  forgiving?)

- Tighten up the spec for indentation of "constructs using complex
  markers": field lists and option lists?  Bodies may begin on the
  same line as the marker or on a subsequent line (with blank lines
  optional).  Require that for bodies beginning on the same line as
  the marker, all lines be in strict alignment.  Currently, this is
  acceptable::

      :Field-name-of-medium-length: Field body beginning on the same
          line as the field name.

  This proposal would make the above example illegal, instead
  requiring strict alignment.  A field body may either begin on the
  same line::

      :Field-name-of-medium-length: Field body beginning on the same
                                    line as the field name.

  Or it may begin on a subsequent line::

      :Field-name-of-medium-length:
          Field body beginning on a line subsequent to that of the
          field name.

  This would be especially relevant in degenerate cases like this::

      :Number-of-African-swallows-requried-to-carry-a-coconut:
          It would be very difficult to align the field body with
          the left edge of the first line if it began on the same
          line as the field name.

- Make footnotes two-way, GNU-style?  What if there are multiple
  references to a single footnote?

- Allow for variant styles by interpreting indented lists as if they
  weren't indented?  For example, currently the list below will be
  parsed as a list within a block quote::

      paragraph

        * list item 1
        * list item 2

  But a lot of people seem to write that way, and HTML browsers make
  it look as if that's the way it should be.  The parser could check
  the contents of block quotes, and if they contain only a single
  list, remove the block quote wrapper.  There would be two problems:

  1. What if we actually *do* want a list inside a block quote?

  2. What if such a list comes immediately after an indented
     construct, such as a literal block?

  Both could be solved using empty comments (problem 2 already exists
  for a block quote after a literal block).  But that's a hack.

  See the Doc-SIG discussion starting 2001-04-18 with Ed Loper's
  "Structuring: a summary; and an attempt at EBNF", item 4.

- Make the parser modular.  Allow syntax constructs to be added or
  disabled at run-time.  Or is subclassing enough?

- Continue to report (info, level 1) enumerated lists whose start
  value is not ordinal-1?


Directives
``````````

- Allow directives to be added at run-time.

- Use the language module for directive attribute names?

- Add more attributes to the image directive: align, border?

- Implement directives:

  - _`html.imagemap` (Useful outside of HTML?  If not, replace with
    image only in non-HTML writers?)

  - _`parts.endnotes`
  
  - _`parts.citations`
  
  - _`parts.topic`
  
  - _`parts.sectnum` (section numbering; add support to .contents;
    could be cmdline option also)

  - _`misc.raw`

  - _`misc.include`: ``#include`` one file in another.  But how to
    parse wrt sections, reference names, conflicts?  Parse it in the
    current document's context (C-preprocessor semantics), or
    separately and then merge?

    Use C-preprocessor semantics for locating include files?  E.g.,
    ``.. include:: file.txt`` will read another file into the current
    one, relative to the current file's directory, and ``.. include::
    <standard>`` will read a standard include file from
    ``docutils/include/``.  (Should "quotes" be required around
    non-standard include files?)

  - _`misc.exec`: Execute Python code & insert the results.  Perhaps
    dangerous?

  - _`misc.eval`: Evaluate an expression & insert the text.  At parse
    time or at substitution time?  Dangerous?  Perhaps limit to canned
    macros; see text.date_ below.

  - @@@ _`body.qa`/faq/questions: Questions & Answers.  Implement as a
    generic two-column marked list?  As a standalone (non-directive)
    construct?  (Is the markup ambiguous?)  Add support to
    parts.Contents (optional attribute "qa" done).

    New elements would be required.  Perhaps::

        <!ELEMENT question_list (question_list_item+)>
        <!ATTLIST question_list
            numbered  (no | local | global)  #IMPLIED
            start     NUMBER    #IMPLIED>
        <!ELEMENT question_list_item (question, answer*)>
        <!ELEMENT question %text.model;>
        <!ELEMENT answer (%body.elements;)+>

  - _`body.columns`: Multi-column table/list, with number of columns
    as argument.

  - _`body.verse`: Paragraphs with linebreaks preserved, *and* inline
    markup support too.  Use cases: verse (poetry, song lyrics, etc.),
    address blocks.  A directive would be easy; what about a
    literal-block-like prefix, perhaps ';;'?  (It's a semi-literal
    block, after all.)  Example::

        Take it away, Eric the Orchestra Leader!  ;;

            A one, two, a one two three four

            Half a bee, philosophically,
            must, *ipso facto*, half not be.
            But half the bee has got to be,
            *vis a vis* its entity.  D'you see?

            But can a bee be said to be
            or not to be an entire bee,
            when half the bee is not a bee,
            due to some ancient injury?

            Singing...

    New elements would be required.  Perhaps::

        <!ELEMENT verse (stanza | verse)+>
        <!ELEMENT stanza (line+)>
        <!ELEMENT line %text.model;>

    We could get away without "line" elements, treating line breaks
    within "stanzas" as significant.  But explicit is perhaps better
    than implicit.

    Within a "verse" element, should any other constructs be allowed?
    Should lists be recognized?  The equivalent of block quotes (i.e.,
    further indented blocks) would be nested verse elements.  These
    could be "chorus" blocks.

    Perhaps individually indented "continuation lines" should also be
    recognized (maybe with a "continuation" attribute on the "line"
    element, or significant whitespace in a single "line")::

        "To Ma Own Beloved Lassie: A Poem on her 17th Birthday", by
        Ewan McTeagle (for Lassie O'Shea): ;;

            Lend us a couple of bob till Thursday.
            I'm absolutely stint.
            But I'm expecting a postal order and I can pay you back
                as soon as it comes.
            Love, Ewan.

  - _`colorize.python`: Colorize Python code.  Fine for HTML output,
    but what about other formats?  Revert to a literal block?  Do we
    need some kind of "alternate" mechanism?  Perhaps use a "pending"
    transform, which could switch its output based on the "format" in
    use.  Use a factory function "transformFF()" which returns either
    "HTMLTransform()" instance or "GenericTransform" instance?

  - _`text.date`: Datestamp.  For substitutions.

    - Combined with misc.include_, implement canned macros?  E.g.::

          .. include:: <macros>

          Today's date is |date|.

      Where "macros" contains ``.. |date| date::``, among others.


Unimplemented Transforms
------------------------

- Footnote Gathering

  Collect and move footnotes to the end of a document.

- Hyperlink Target Gathering

  It probably comes in two phases, because in a Python context we need
  to *resolve* them on a per-docstring basis [do we? --DG], but if the
  user is trying to do the callout form of presentation, they would
  then want to group them all at the end of the document.

- Reference Merging

  When merging two or more subdocuments (such as docstrings),
  conflicting references may need to be resolved.  There may be:

  - duplicate reference and/or substitution names that need to be made
    unique; and/or
  - duplicate footnote numbers that need to be renumbered.

  Should this be done before or after reference-resolving transforms
  are applied?  What about references from within one subdocument to
  inside another?

- Document Splitting

  If the processed document is written to multiple files (possibly in
  a directory tree), it will need to be split up.  References will
  have to be adjusted.

  (HTML only?)

- Navigation

  If a document is split up, each segment will need navigation links:
  parent, children (small TOC), previous (preorder), next (preorder).

- Index


HTML Writer
-----------

- @@ Allow for style sheet info to be passed in, either as a <LINK>,
  or as embedded style info.

- @ Construct a templating system, as in ht2html/yaptu, using
  directives and substitutions for dynamic stuff.

- @@ Improve the granularity of document parts in the HTML writer, so
  that one could just grab the parts needed.

- @@ Return a string instead of writing to a file?  Leave all I/O up
  to the client?  Or up to an explicit distributor/filer?


Coding Conventions
==================

This project shall follow the generic coding conventions as specified
in the `Style Guide for Python Code`__ and `Docstring Conventions`__
PEPs, with the following clarifications:

- 4 spaces per indentation level.  No tabs.
- No one-liner compound statements (i.e., no ``if x: return``: use two
  lines & indentation), except for degenerate class or method
  definitions (i.e., ``class X: pass`` is O.K.).
- Lines should be no more than 78 or 79 characters long.
- "CamelCase" shall be used for class names (except for element
  classes in docutils.nodes).
- Use "lowercase" or "lowercase_with_underscores" for function,
  method, and variable names.  For short names, maximum two joined
  words, use lowercase (e.g. 'tagname').  For long names with three or
  more joined words, or where it's hard to parse the split between two
  words, use lowercase_with_underscores (e.g., 'note_explicit_target',
  'explicit_target').  If in doubt, use underscores.
