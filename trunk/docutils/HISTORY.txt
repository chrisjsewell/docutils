Changes Since 0.1
========================

* docutils/parsers/rst/states.py:

  - Added RFC-2822 header support.

* test: Made test modules standalone (subdirectories became packages).

* test/DocutilsTestSupport.py: Support for RFC-2822 testing.

* test/package_unittest.py: Renamed from UnitTestFolder.py.

  - Now supports true packages containing test modules
    (``__init__.py`` files required); fixes duplicate module name bug.

* spec/pep-0257.txt: Clarified prohibition of signature repetition.

* spec/rst/reStructuredText.txt: Clarified field list usage.

* spec/rst/alternatives.txt: Expanded auto-numbered enumerated list
  idea; thanks to Fred Bremmer.


Release 0.1 (2002-04-20)
========================

This is the first release of Docutils, merged from the now inactive
reStructuredText__ and `Docstring Processing System`__ projects.  For
the pre-Docutils history, see the `reStructuredText HISTORY`__ and the
`DPS HISTORY`__ files.

General changes: renamed 'dps' package to 'docutils'; renamed
'restructuredtext' subpackage to 'rst'; merged the codebases; merged
the test suites (reStructuredText's test/test_states renamed to
test/test_rst); and all modifications required to make it all work.

* docutils/parsers/rst/states.py:

  - Improved diagnostic system messages for missing blank lines.
  - Fixed substitution_reference bug.
