Most of the files included in this project are in the public domain,
and therefore have no license requirement and no restrictions on
copying or usage.  The exceptions are:

- docutils/optik.py, copyright Gregory P. Ward, licensed under the BSD
  license (which can be found in the module's source code).

- docutils/roman.py, copyright by Mark Pilgrim, licensed under the
  `Python 2.1.1 license`_.

- test/difflib.py, copyright by the Python Software Foundation,
  licensed under the `Python 2.2 license`_.  This file is included for
  compatibility with Python versions less than 2.2; if you have Python
  2.2 or higher, difflib.py is not needed and may be removed.  (It's
  only used to report test failures anyhow; it isn't installed
  anywhere.  The included file is a pre-generator version of the
  difflib.py module included in Python 2.2.)

(Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer.)  Both the BSD license and the Python
license are OSI-approved_ and GPL-compatible_.  Although complicated
by multiple owners and lots of legalese, the Python license basically
lets you copy, use, modify, and redistribute files as long as you keep
the copyright attribution intact, note any changes you make, and don't
use the owner's name in vain.  The BSD license is similar.
