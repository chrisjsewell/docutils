    Include or exclude elements which depend on a specific Docutils component.

    For use with `nodes.pending` elements.  A "pending" element's dictionary
    attribute ``details`` must contain a key matching the dependency component
    type (e.g. ``details['writer']`` for a "pending" element whose ``stage``
    attribute is 'last writer').  The value is the name of a specific format
    or context of that component (e.g. ``details['writer'] = 'html'``).  If
    the Docutils component which called this transform supports that format or
    context, the "pending" element is replaced by the nodes in
    ``details['nodes']``; otherwise, the "pending" element is removed.

    For example, the reStructuredText "meta" directive creates a "pending"
    element containing a "meta" element.  Only writers supporting the "html"
    format will include the "meta" element; it will be deleted from the output
    of all other writers.
