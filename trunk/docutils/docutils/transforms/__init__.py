This package contains modules for standard tree transforms available
to Docutils components. Tree transforms serve a variety of purposes:

- To tie up certain syntax-specific "loose ends" that remain after the
  initial parsing of the input plaintext. These transforms are used to
  supplement a limited syntax.

- To automate the internal linking of the document tree (hyperlink
  references, footnote references, etc.).

- To extract useful information from the document tree. These
  transforms may be used to construct (for example) indexes and tables
  of contents.

Each transform is an optional step that a Docutils Reader may choose to
perform on the parsed document, depending on the input context. A Docutils
Reader may also perform Reader-specific transforms before or after performing
these standard transforms.
