Some Tests for the LaTeX Writer
===============================

These tests have been written to exercise some unusual combinations of
syntax elements which may cause trouble for the LaTeX writer but do
not need to be tested with other writers (e.g. the HTML writer).

This file is not yet used by any automated test.  It is currently only
used to control the visual appearance of the output.
