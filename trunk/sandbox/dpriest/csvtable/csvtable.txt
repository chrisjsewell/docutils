CSV Table
=========

:Directive Type: "csvtable"
:Doctree Element: table
:Directive Arguments: 1, optional (table title).
:Directive Options: Possible.
:Directive Content: A CSV (comma-separated values) table.

The "csvtable" directive is used to create a table::

    .. csvtable:: Frozen Delights!
       :headers: "Treat" "Quantity" "Description"
       :widths: 15, 10, 30

       "Albatross", 2.99, "On a stick!"
       "Crunchy Frog", 1.49, "If we took the bones out, it wouldn't be crunchy now, would it?"
       "Gannet Ripple", 1.99, "On a stick!"

The following options are recognized:

``class`` : text
    Set a "class" attribute value on the table element.  See the
    class_ directive below.

``headrows`` : integer
    The number of rows to use in the table header. Optional:
    defaults to 1 unless ``headers`` is also defined.

``headers`` : "column head" ["column head"...]
    Sets column table headers. Optional: if defined, ``headrows``
    defaults to 0 unless explicitly overridden.

``widths`` : integer [, integer...]
    A comma-separated list of relative column widths.  Optional:
    defaults to equal-width columns (100%/#columns).

``file`` | ``url`` : path
    Path or URL to CSV file.  Optional.

``delim`` : [char | tab | space | lf | ff | vt | hex ##]
    A one-character string used to separate fields. Optional:
    defaults to ``,`` (comma).

``quote`` : [char | tab | space | lf | ff | vt | hex ##]
    A one-character string used to quote elements containing
    the delimiter or which start with the quote character. Optional:
    defaults to ``"`` (quote).

``lineend`` : [cr | lf | crlf]
    The string used to terminate lines in the CSV file.  Useful only
    for external CSV files.  Optional: defaults to ``crlf``
    (carriage return + linefeed).

``skipspace`` :
    When defined, whitespace immediately following the delimiter is ignored.
    Optional: when not defined, whitespace is not ignored.

``escape`` : [char | tab | space | lf | ff | vt | hex ##]
    A one-character string used to escape the delimiter or quote characters.
    Used when the delimiter is used in an unquoted field, or when quote
    characters are used within a field.
    Optional: defaults is to double-up the character, ie) "He said, ""Hi!"""

Working Limitations::

    Inline formatting within cells is supported.  Line ends are not recognized
    within a cell, thus block formatting within cells is largely unsupported.
    (Block formatting works only for the first line of the cell.)

    Whitespace delimiters are supported only for external CSV files.

    When using the ``hex ##`` character definition there must be only a single
    space before the hexadecimal number.

    There is no support for checking that the number of columns in each row is
    the same.  This is of benefit to some types of tables.  The results of
    non-standard column counts is unpredictable, and will depend on the
    particular Writer you are using.

    This directive is not Unicode compatible.  It may also have problems with
    ASCII NUL characters.  Accordingly, CSV tables should be ASCII-printable
    safe.
