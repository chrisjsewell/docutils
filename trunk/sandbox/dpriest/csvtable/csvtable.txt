CSV Table
=========

:Directive Type: "csvtable"
:Doctree Element: table
:Directive Arguments: 1, optional (table title).
:Directive Options: Possible.
:Directive Content: A CSV (comma-separated values) table.

The "csvtable" directive is used to create a table from CSV
(comma-separated values) data.  CSV is a common data format generated
by spreadsheet applications and commercial databases.

Example::

    .. csvtable:: Frozen Delights!
       :headers: "Treat", "Quantity", "Description"
       :widths: 15, 10, 30

       "Albatross", 2.99, "On a stick!"
       "Crunchy Frog", 1.49, "If we took the bones out, it wouldn't be
       crunchy, now would it?"
       "Gannet Ripple", 1.99, "On a stick!"

Block markup and inline markup within cells is supported.  Line ends
are recognized within cells.

Supports CSV generators that do not insert "empty" entries at the end
of short rows.

Working Limitations::

* Whitespace delimiters are supported only for external CSV files.

* When using the ``hex ##`` character definition there must be only a
  single space before the hexadecimal number.

* There is no support for checking that the number of columns in each
  row is the same.

  .. [This is of benefit to some types of tables.  The results of
     non-standard column counts is unpredictable, and will depend on
     the particular Writer you are using.]

  .. Add "strict" option to verify input?

* Due to limitations of the CSV parser, this directive is not Unicode
  compatible.  It may also have problems with ASCII NUL characters.
  Accordingly, CSV tables should be ASCII-printable safe.

  .. Test with Unicode; see if that's really so.  "encoding" option?

The following options are recognized:

``class`` : text
    Set a "class" attribute value on the table element.  See the
    class_ directive below.

``widths`` : integer [, integer...]
    A comma-separated list of relative column widths.  The default is
    equal-width columns (100%/#columns).

``header-rows`` : integer
    The number of rows of CSV data to use in the table header.
    Defaults to 0.

``header`` : CSV data
    Supplemental data for the table header, added independently of and
    before any ``header-rows`` from the main CSV data.  Must use the
    same CSV format as the main CSV data.

``file`` | ``url`` : path
    Path or URL to CSV file.

``delim`` : char | "tab" | "space" | "lf" | "ff" | "vt" | "hex ##"
    A one-character string used to separate fields.  Defaults to ``,``
    (comma).

    .. Would whitespace other than tab or space ever be used?  I doubt
       it.  

    .. Instead of "hex ##", use the same syntax as the "unicode"
       directive.

``quote`` : char | "tab" | "space" | "lf" | "ff" | "vt" | "hex ##"
    A one-character string used to quote elements containing the
    delimiter or which start with the quote character.  Defaults to
    ``"`` (quote).

    .. I doubt whitespace would ever be used for quoting.  "char" only
       should be fine.

``keepspace`` : flag
    Treat whitespace immediately following the delimiter as
    significant.  The default is to ignore such whitespace.

``escape`` : char | "tab" | "space" | "lf" | "ff" | "vt" | "hex ##"
    A one-character string used to escape the delimiter or quote
    characters.  Used when the delimiter is used in an unquoted field,
    or when quote characters are used within a field.  The default is
    to double-up the character, e.g. "He said, ""Hi!"""

    .. Again, doubtful if whitespace would ever be used.  Just "char".
