    * DocArticle/DocArticle/__init__.py: Added sidebar and title_reference
    support.

    * DocArticle/DocArticle/__init__.py: Improved formatting of admonitions.
    Sort of.  Would like to make them better.  Maybe add little icons, if
    icons are enabled (need to fix settings). 
    * DocArticle/DocArticle/__init__.py: Improved formatting of
    abstract/dedication block.  Now in 'box' w/abstract/dedication centered
    at top.  Should all be in italics, but that'll hose the body formatting
    of the contained text.

    * DocArticle/DocArticle/__init__.py: Can now successfully [I think]
    process test.txt.  Output is not exactly pretty yet.

    * Added support for subtitle, note, and block_quote.  Cleaned up a
      compile of CSS leftovers.
    * DocArticle/DocArticle/__init__.py: Added support for arbitrary fields
      and moved docinfo presentation to being table based (so that multiline
      field values actually work).   Lots of cleanup-- reordered a bunch of
      methods that had gotten out of order.  Added limited support for
      Admonitions-- not at all useful yet.
      (HTMLDocArticleTranslator.visit_enumerated_list): Added support for
      enumerated lists and modified the paragraph tag rules for all lists.
      (HTMLDocArticleTranslator.visit_enumerated_list): Added support for
      non-css based typed enumerated lists.

    * DocArticle/DocArticle/__init__.py: Added support for subtitle and
      block_quote nodes.
    * Added initial working implementation of DocArticle HTML writer.
    * 00README.txt: Added basic information.
    (HTMLDocArticleTranslator.__init__): Moved to a more traditional
      initialization of instance variables.
