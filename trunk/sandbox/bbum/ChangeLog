    * Added support for subtitle, note, and block_quote.  Cleaned up a
      compile of CSS leftovers.
    * DocArticle/DocArticle/__init__.py: Added support for arbitrary fields
      and moved docinfo presentation to being table based (so that multiline
      field values actually work).   Lots of cleanup-- reordered a bunch of
      methods that had gotten out of order.  Added limited support for
      Admonitions-- not at all useful yet.

      initialization of instance variables.
