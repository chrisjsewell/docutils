What is xml2rst?
================

`xml2rst` is a tool to generate reStructuredText_ syntax back from
`Docutils XML`_ input. This way you can an create XML files using
`Docutils XML`_ from some other format (such as ODF_) and then
transform them to reStructuredText_.

.. _flavor:

It is currently implemented as an XSLT_ stylesheet coming in three
flavors:

1. ``xml2rst.py``

   This script uses ``rst/xml2rst.xsl`` through the XSLT_ engine
   available through the lxml_ package [#deb-lxml]_.

   This is the preferred method of using `xml2rst` but depends on the
   lxml_ package. This is also what is installed normally.

   .. [#deb-lxml] Under Debian based operating systems try ``apt-get
      install python-lxml``.

2. ``rst/xml2rst.xsl``

   This is the core XSLT_ script. It uses EXSLT_ and therefore needs
   an EXSLT_ capable XSLT_ processors such as xsltproc_
   [#deb-xsltproc]_.

   If you can't use ``xml2rst.py`` you may try this flavor.

   .. [#deb-xsltproc] Under Debian based operating systems try
      ``apt-get install xsltproc``.

3. ``rst/xml2rst-noexslt.xsl``

   This version can be processed with every XSLT_ processor like
   Xalan_ [#deb-xalan]_.

   This version is no longer actively maintained, though.

   .. [#deb-xalan] Under Debian based operating systems try ``apt-get
      install xalan``.

Availability
============

`xml2rst` is available through the `Docutils Subversion repository`_
as part of the Docutils sandbox at
http://svn.berlios.de/viewcvs/docutils/trunk/sandbox/xml2rst

Moreover you can fetch it directly from the current maintainer at
http://www.merten-home.de/FreeSoftware/xml2rst/

Installation
============

After you obtained the package run ``python setup.py install``.

Depending on the flavor_ you choose you need to install certain
packages to run `xml2rst`. If using an XSLT_ processor try ``perldoc
xml2rst.xsl`` for instructions how to run it.

Development
===========

Tests
-----

There are test suites in ``tests*``. Use filterunit_ to run tests.

ToDos
-----

``xml2rst.xsl`` and ``xml2rst.py`` contain a couple of comments marked
with ``TODO`` which contain things which should be done.

Plans
-----

``xml2rst`` should become a normal reStructuredText writer.
