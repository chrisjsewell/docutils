  <p>
    Sorry, but the requested URL does not exist. We recently updated the
    python documentation and the names of the URLs changed so that they
    are easier to guess. Some of the old URLs still work and redirect to
    the new location, others do not because they were way too generic.

  <h3>You can</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="{{ pathto("index.rst") }}">Click here</a> to go to the index.</li>
    <li><a href="{{ pathto("search.rst") }}">Search for</a> this topic.</li>
    <li><a href="#">file a bug</a> when you think that there is something missing.</li>
  </ul>
