About these documents
=====================

These documents are generated from `reStructuredText
<http://docutils.sf.net/rst.html>`_ sources by *Sphinx*, a document processor
specifically written for the Python documentation.

In the online version of these documents, you can submit comments and suggest
changes directly on the documentation pages.

Development of the documentation and its toolchain takes place on the
docs@python.org mailing list.  We're always looking for volunteers wanting
to help with the docs, so feel free to send a mail there!

See :ref:`reporting-bugs` for information how to report bugs in Python itself.
