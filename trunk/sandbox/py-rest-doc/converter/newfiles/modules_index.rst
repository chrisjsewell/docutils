###############################
  The Python standard library
###############################

:Release: |version|
:Date: |today|

While :ref:`reference-index` describes the exact syntax and semantics of the
language, it does not describe the standard library that is distributed with the
language, and which greatly enhances its immediate usability. This library
contains built-in modules (written in C) that provide access to system
functionality such as file I/O that would otherwise be inaccessible to Python
programmers, as well as modules written in Python that provide standardized
solutions for many problems that occur in everyday programming. Some of these
modules are explicitly designed to encourage and enhance the portability of
Python programs.

This library reference manual documents Python's standard library, as well as
many optional library modules (which may or may not be available, depending on
whether the underlying platform supports them and on the configuration choices
made at compile time). It also documents the standard types of the language and
its built-in functions and exceptions, many of which are not or incompletely
documented in the Reference Manual.
