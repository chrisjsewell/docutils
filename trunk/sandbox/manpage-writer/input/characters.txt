test special characters
-----------------------

DESCRIPTION
===========

encodings are problematic as alway.

* accents:

  - right: ´
  - left: `

* quotes: 

  - straight: ' 
  - double: " 
  - single: ‘ ’
  - double: “ ”

Some text afterwards, test.txt ended with quotes test.
Unicode breaks the man processing chain. The display 
ends with ``single:`` .
