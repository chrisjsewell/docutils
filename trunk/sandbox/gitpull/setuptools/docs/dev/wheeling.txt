Abstract
--------

This document documents my trial to build python wheels from 
docutils. Once it is finished it might be driven into distribution or
release documentation.

Requests
--------

There is `feature request 43`_ :  Make setup.py build wheels. 

  Just add this to setup.cfg:

  [bdist_wheel]
  universal = 1

  See https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/distributing.html#universal-wheels

  -.-.-
  
  Docutils is not fit for Universal Wheels. Docutils supports both Python 2 and
  3, but with different code (we use “2to3”). This would make it a candidate
  for "Pure Python wheels".

  https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/distributing.html#pure-python-wheels

and bugs275_ : Upload wheels to pypi 

  Currently docutils does not publish any wheels on pypi. Wheels make docutils
  faster to install (no need to run setup.py, which for a large number of
  packages can take some time), and is no more difficult than uploading an
  sdist (see https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/distributing.html#wheels
  for instructions).

Logbook 
-------

1. Add ``[bdist_wheel] universal = 0`` to setup.cfg.
2. Run ``python setup.py bdist_wheel``::

     error: invalid command 'bdist_wheel'

3. setuptools is too old. Install the new one by wheel or source or pip or easy...

4. try wheel ... first get wheel tar.gz and unpack.

5. try ::

     python2.7 wheel-0.24.0/wheel install setuptools-15.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl

   no error. But still ``error: invalid command 'bdist_wheel'``::

     $ python2.7 setup.py --version
     0.12

   Did wheel install ? If no, why no error, if yes in which place ?
