Slideshow Title
===============

.. The main title above is used as slideshow title, but each slide has to
   start with a subtitle, including the very first slide. The title of
   the first slide will be the same as the main title above in most cases.
   
   There must not be any visible text between the main title and the first
   subtitle. It would be visible on all slides.
