A short introduction to the S5 converter for Docutils


Introduction
------------

``rst2s5.py`` is a Docutils__ front-end tool that outputs HTML
compatible with S5__, a Simple Standards-based Slide Show System.

* A simple reStructuredText-format text file serves as input.

* Presentations can be viewed using any modern web browser (CSS,
  JavaScript, XHTML).

* Several themes are available on the Internet, easy to adapt.

  .. handout::
     Some sites with S5 slideshows or themes:

     * http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/themes/
     * http://mozilla.wikicities.com/wiki/Firefox_S5:Designs

     And a short tutorial on how to create themes:
     http://yatil.de/s5/dokumentation/9/ (german text)

* The slides and handout can be combined in one document.  The handout
  will not just contain the silly framed slides.

Usage
-----

Based on Docutils, normal ``reST`` documents are supported.  Each
section is converted to a single slide.

.. sidebar:: Installation
   :class: handout

   Prerequisites: Python and the docutils package have to be
   installed.

   Install ``s5.py`` in docutils/writers, ``rst2s5.py`` to a directory
   in the ``$PATH``.  (Or copy both files to the same folder,
   e.g. ``/usr/local/bin`` on un*x).

A slideshow is simply made by the following command::

    rst2s5.py presentation.txt presentation.html

Some additional files are needed to view a presentation. These go into
the same directory as ``presentation.html``

* The Docutils stylesheet ``default.css``.

  .. handout::
     The ``default.css`` stylesheet is included in the standard
     docutils distribution.  One can also be downloaded from here:
     http://docutils.sf.net/tools/stylesheets/default.css

* A subdirectory ``ui`` with the S5 theme (CSS and JavaScript).

  .. handout::
     By default, the slideshow uses the ``ui`` theme, but that can be
     overriden by a command line option; see below.

     The theme from the S5 tutorial can be used.  Get it here:
     http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/s5blank.zip

     Most of these themes are available under a `Creative Commons
     Share Alike`__ license.  This means the themes can be used for
     commercial and non-commercial purposes.  But the ``rst2s5``
     converter has a different license.  Therefore no theme is
     distributed along with the converter.

.. class:: handout
.. hint:: Basic steps to create a slideshow:

   1. Open a console (terminal, command shell) go to the folder
      containing ``presentation.txt``.
   2. Run ``rst2s5.py presentation.txt presentation.html``.
   3. Put ``default.css`` in the same folder.  (Get it from
      http://docutils.sf.net/tools/stylesheets/default.css.)
   4. Extract the sample theme from
      http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/s5blank.zip in the same folder
      (this should create a ``ui`` subfolder).
   5. Open ``presentation.html`` in a web browser.


Features
--------

``rst2s5`` is based on ``rst2html``, and it basically supports all of
its features.

Specifics:

* The document title is duplicated on each slide in the S5 footer.

* The ``footer`` directive may be used to define additional text in
  the S5 footer, limited to one paragraph.

  .. handout::
     This is useful for information such as the date of the
     presentation and/or the location.

     The field in the footer is left blank if the directive is not
     used.

     Example::

         .. footer:: Location - Date

Additions:

* ``.. handout::``: The contents of the "handout" directive are only
  visible when the presentation is printed.  They are hidden in the
  screen presentation.

  .. handout::
     Handout contents are also visible on the screen if the S5 "raw
     view mode" is active.

     The text in a "handout" directive block or elements with a
     "class" attribute of "handout" are hidden in the slideshow on the
     screen.  This can be used to provide more detailed information in
     a handout.

     "Handout" directives can appear anywhere in the text, as often as
     needed.

* The S5 theme (directory name) can be specified with the ``--theme``
  command-line option or "theme" configuration file setting.

  .. handout::
     Example::

         rst2s5 --theme pixel presentation.txt presentation.html

     The default theme is "ui".

     Usualy, themes are placed in a subfolder with the specified name,
     in the same folder as the presentation.  But it is also possible
     to use URLs and grab the design from another website.


Samples: Tables, Directives, Images
-----------------------------------

.. sidebar:: Images are OK

    .. image:: ui/bodybg.gif
       :scale: 30
       :alt: sample image

=====  =====  ======
   Inputs     Output
------------  ------
  A      B    A or B
=====  =====  ======
False  False  False
True   False  True
False  True   True
True   True   True
=====  =====  ======

.. hint:: Admonitions, tables, sidebars and others can be used on the
   screen and in the handout.

.. sidebar:: Handout only
   :class: handout

   Elements only visible in the handout can also be generated using a
   ":class: handout" option with "sidebar", "compound" and other
   directives.

.. class:: handout

The ``.. class:: handout`` directive can be used to tag single
paragraphs and other elements.


Caveats
-------

* The ``.. contents::`` directive must not be used.  It changes the
  CSS class of headings and they won't show up correctly in the screen
  presentation.

  [Add a "disable table of contents" setting to the parser?  The S5
  writer could set it as a default.]

* ``.. handout::`` directives generate an error if other ``rst2...``
  converters are used, instead of the S5 converter.

  [How to avoid this?]
