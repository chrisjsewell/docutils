Notes on Unit Test Additions for Python LaTeX
=============================================


DocutilsTestSupport.py
======================

Added two classes (PythonLatexPublishTestCase and
PythonLatexPublishTestSuite) that drive the tests.  These classes
were modelled on classes LatexPublishTestCase and
LatexPublishTestSuite respectively.

Note that class PythonLatexPublishTestCase overrides method
compare_output and adds method remove_lines.  These methods remove
the "generated on" lines from both input and output because the
date will always differ.

See file DocutilsTestSupport.patch


test_writers/test_python_latex.py
=================================

Contains the tests.


test_writers/Data/*
===================

Contains reST source documents (*.txt) and generated LaTeX
documents (*.tex) that were used in the input and output strings
in test_python_latex.py.
