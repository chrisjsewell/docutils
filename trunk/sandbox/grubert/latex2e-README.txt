To do
~~~~~

* commandline option -l de did not work.

* check indentation in verbatim is right.

* additional docinfo items: the field_body is inserted as text.

* docinfo item names must be translated.  
  author, date, ... use self.language.labels

  docinfo environment tabular fails on long lines.
  tabualrx, description, ...
	
* knowing that the latex code will be used for pdf generation would allow
  to set pdf document information.

  for pdflatex package times gives smaller files than paladino.

  but setting this automatic might result in including several font packages.

* ATTENTION:
  put labeling inside environments.
