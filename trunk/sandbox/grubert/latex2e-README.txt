To do
~~~~~

* table cells with multirow and multicolumn

* enumeration too deep

* meta keywords into pdf ?

* pagestyle headings does not work, when sections are starred.

* latex does not hyphenate here. 

* check indentation in verbatim is right.

* authors is handled wrong.

* using astext() to get text into verbatim, removes reST markups.

* additional docinfo items: the field_body is inserted as text.

* docinfo environment tabular fails on long lines.
  tabualrx, description, ...
	
* for pdflatex package times gives smaller files than paladino.

  but setting this automatic might result in including several font packages.

* ATTENTION:
  put labeling inside environments.
