This month sandbox menu is a pdf writer using
reportlab lib.

I am unsure it it will ever work, justification might
need hyphenation and automatic sizing of table cells
seams to be nontrivial (considering the size of the
usual html browsers).

A better layout might be possible via the latex2e writer.
(on next month menu).

I try to approach davids structure and work and 
coding conventions but slowly as a morning sunrise.
