Link formatting
---------------

especially the hash "#" character is problematic for LaTeX as it is
used in LaTeX's macro language.

Explicit targets and references.

.. raw:: latex

   \label{section_2}

.. _example:

This paragraph is pointed to by the explicit "example" target.

.. raw:: latex

    \newpage

This is an internal cross-references (example_).

This is an internal cross-references (`hyper links`_).

href offers a named link to a hypertarget.

refpage a link with page-number text to a label.

.. raw:: latex

   \pageref{section_2}


One might consider adding 

``\pageref{key}`` :
  The ``\pageref command produces the page number of the place in 
  the text where the corresponding ``\label`` command appears. ie. 
  where ``\label{key}`` appears. For a smart version see ``\vpageref``.
``\ref{key}`` :
  The \ref command produces the number of the sectional unit, equation 
  number, ... of the corresponding \label command. For a smart version 
  see \vref.

Smarter version of the original latex2e cross reference commands.
Generated strings are customizable, Babel options are recognized (further
info in the package documentation).

``\vref``, ``\vpageref`` :
  ``\vref`` is similar to ``\ref`` but adds an additional page reference, 
  like on the facing page or on page 27 whenever the corresponding 
  ``\label`` is not on the same page.

  ``\vpageref`` is a variation of ``\pageref`` with similar functionality.
``\vrefrange``, ``\vpagerefrange`` :
  The ``\v...range`` commands take two labels as arguments and produce 
  strings which depend on wether or not these labels fall onto a single 
  page or on different pages.
``\vref*``, ``\vpageref*``, ``\vpagerefrange*`` :
 Star ``*`` variants do not add any space before the generated text for
 situations like: ``(\vref{foo} ...)``
