Footnote testing
================


Paragraphs contain text and may contain inline markup: *emphasis*,
**strong emphasis**, 
footnote references (manually numbered [1]_, 
anonymous auto-numbered [#]_, labeled auto-numbered [#label]_, or 
symbolic [*]_), citation references ([CIT2002]_), and ... 

Footnotes
---------

.. [1] A footnote contains body elements, consistently indented by at
   least 3 spaces.

   This is the footnote's second paragraph.

.. [#label] Footnotes may be numbered, either manually (as in [1]_) or
   automatically using a "#"-prefixed label.  This footnote has a
   label so it can be referred to from multiple places, both as a
   footnote reference ([#label]_) and as a hyperlink reference
   (label_).

.. [#] This footnote is numbered automatically and anonymously using a
   label of "#" only.

.. [*] Footnotes may also use symbols, specified with a "*" label.
   Here's a reference to the next footnote: [*]_.

.. [*] This footnote shows the next symbol in the sequence.

.. [4] Here's a footnote, with a reference to a footnote: [5]_.



Citations
---------

A test citation containing an underscore [underscore_2006]_.

  \bibitem[like{\_}this]{like{\_}this} 
  That places forbidden characters in the citekey. 
  It should produce 
  \bibitem[like{\_}this]{like_this}

.. [#value_initialized] The concept of value-initialization was
   added to the C++ standard in the first "Technical Corrigendum".

   To value-initialize an object of type T means:

   - if T is a class type (clause 9) with a user-declared constructor
     (12.1), then the default constructor for T is 
     called (and the initialization is ill-formed if T has no
     accessible default constructor); 

   - if T is a non-union class type without a user-declared
     constructor, then every non-static data member 
     and base-class component of T is value-initialized;

   - if T is an array type, then each element is value-initialized;

   - otherwise, the object is zero-initialized
