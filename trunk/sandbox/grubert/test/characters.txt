Character tests

bracketts in lists
------------------

LaTeX has some special characters in certain cases, e.g. # is LaTeX's macro
argument chracter.

Bracketts also have some meaning in macros, but need(ed) no special treatment 
up to now.

1. [Advanced] test from dave.
   

   1. The bracketts don't show up. 
      They are in TeX file, but they're missing in PDF and DVI.

      Probably because in LaTeX ::

        \begin{itemize}
        \item one is plain.
        \item [two] two becomes bold.
        \end{itemize}

   2. Numbering [is] also missing for the "Advanced" test case above, not
      here in this line.

   3. Simply escaping the []'s with a backslash in the LaTeX file puts
      "Advanced" centered emphasized on a separate line. But the "1." is
      displayed then.

   4. Using LaTeX's enumerate environment instead of docutils's custom
      list environment for the list does not work too.

*Fix* append "{}" to the item command, i.e. ::



  \item {} [Advanced]

double back qoutes field list names  
-----------------------------------

The *double back qoutes* in the follwing example are ignored, i.e.
they are still *double back quotes* in TeX.

Example


   :The ``lambda`` Operator: A metafunction which transforms a lambda
      expression into a corresponding metafunction class.  

This is not writer but reader specific.
