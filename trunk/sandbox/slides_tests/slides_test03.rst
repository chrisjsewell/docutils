Test 3 for Slides Writers
=========================

Section 1
~~~~~~~~~


Slide 1
=======

- These slides have a title but no subtitle.
- There are sections but no subsections.

  - Which means all slides must be in a section!
    (For sectioning consistency.)

- rst2beamer currently identifies all this
  sectioning correctly (but only because there is no subtitle).
- No other writer correctly handles the sectioning.



Slide 2
=======

A slide in the same section.
