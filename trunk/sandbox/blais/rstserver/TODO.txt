Devel version
-------------

- add title
- style.css
- remove .txt in indexes
- read index.txt if present, concat info
- read titles instead of using filenames (parse by hand)
- filter directories (e.g. cvs)
- use appropriate style.css
- remove second header page
- use HTMLout to produce html?
- what if a file disappears?
- don't output errors from docutils
- add instructions on how to create a config file
- how to setup web server, etc.
- clean up file and functions
- fix major problem with images and links within subdirectories
- add %(home) to the default config parser environment
- add redirect "Please wait... regenerating file."

Ideas:

- parse the whole thing, extract document titles
- generate index.txt for each directory
- unless a special directive is present within the index.txt file (if
  present), concatenate to the read index.txt
- output all documents in a separate root directory, with the same
  structure
- start from buildhtml.py
