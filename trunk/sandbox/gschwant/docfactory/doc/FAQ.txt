How can I manage accentuated characters to be processed properly?
=================================================================

On the "Docutils"-page of the "Project-Settings"-dialog be sure to set 
Docutils' output-encoding to the right value. For example: ``ISO-8859-1``
for french or german accentuated characters. (The default setting is 
``UTF-8``.) The problem is to find out which encoding you need. There is
a wide variety of encodings available. Many of these encodings support 
the same languages. However, they vary in individual characters. For 
example, ``ISO-8859-1`` does not support the EURO SIGN (try ``cp1252``
if you need it). If you face problems your first attempt should be
to try out Python's different standard encodings which can be found
at |www.python.org|.

Is it possible to run DocFactory on systems without a Python installation?
==========================================================================

The Docfactory-tarball contains a script called ``docfactory2exe.py``. If 
|py2exe| is installed on your machine you can use this script to convert 
``docfactory.py`` into a into an executable Windows program, which is able 
to run without requiring a Python installation.  Copy ``docfactory2exe.py``
and ``docfactory.ico`` (both part of the tarball) to the directory where 
``docfactory.py`` is located, go to the command-line and enter

::

  python docfactory2exe.py py2exe -w -p encodings,docutils --icon docfactory.ico

This will create a sub-directory ``dist\docfactory``, containing the file
``docfactory.exe`` and several other files needed at runtime.  (Visit
|py2exe| for more details.)
