Obtaining the Docutils Code
===========================
The latest snapshot of the docutils code is located at sourcforge as a 
tarball_. 

Alternatively, you can get direct access to the subversion server as described
on the docutils site in the `repository instructions`_.

Organization of the Docutils Code
=================================
Within the docutils directory, the package for docutils is in a 
subdirectory also called docutils. This directory contains both
modules and subpackages.

Modules in Docutils
===================
__init__.py
-----------
The __init__ module contains base classes and
functions that are inherited in other modules 
throughout the docutils package.

core.py
-------
The core module contains the `Publisher` object.
  
Calling the ``publish_*`` convenience functions (or instantiating a
`Publisher` object) with component names will result in default
behavior.  For custom behavior (setting component options), create
custom component objects first, and pass *them* to
``publish_*``/`Publisher`.  See `The Docutils Publisher`_.

.. _The Docutils Publisher: http://docutils.sf.net/docs/api/publisher.html
  
frontend.py
-----------
Command-line and common processing for Docutils front-end tools. 
Includes classes which parse options and functions for proccessing those options.

io.py
-----
I/O classes provide a uniform API for low-level input and output.  Subclasses
will exist for a variety of input/output mechanisms.

nodes.py
--------
Docutils document tree element class library. 

Classes in CamelCase are abstract base classes or auxiliary classes. The one
exception is `Text`, for a text (PCDATA) node; uppercase is used to
differentiate from element classes.  Classes in lower_case_with_underscores
are element classes, matching the XML element generic identifiers in the DTD_.

The position of each node (the level at which it can occur) is significant and
is represented by abstract base classes (`Root`, `Structural`, `Body`,
`Inline`, etc.).  Certain transformations will be easier because we can use
``isinstance(node, base_class)`` to determine the position of the node in the
hierarchy.

.. _DTD: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/docutils.dtd

statemachine.py
---------------
A finite state machine specialized for regular-expression-based text 
filters. This module is used by the reST parser, but is designed to 
be of general utility.
  
urischemes.py
-------------
`schemes` is a dictionary with lowercase URI addressing schemes as
keys and descriptions as values.
  
utils.py
--------
Miscellaneous utilities for the documentation utilities.

examples.py
-----------
Contains practical examples of Docutils client code.

Subpackages in Docutils
=======================

languages
---------
This package contains modules for language-dependent features of Docutils.

parsers
-------
This package contains Docutils parser modules. 

:null.py: A module containing a parser which does nothing. This is used
	when transforming from a pickled document tree to any form.

:rst: A subpackage containing the parser for reStructuredText. The 
	reStructuredText parser is implemented as a state machine, examining
	its input one line at a time. To understand how the parser works,
	please first become familiar with the `docutils.statemachine` module,
	then see the `states` module.

readers
-------
This package contains Docutils Reader modules. Each reader module or 
package must export a subclass also called 'Reader'. The three steps
of a Reader's responsibility are defined: `scan()`, `parse()`, and 
`transform()`. Call `read()` to process a document.

transforms
----------
This package contains modules for standard tree transforms available
to Docutils components. Tree transforms serve a variety of purposes:

- To tie up certain syntax-specific "loose ends" that remain after the
  initial parsing of the input plaintext. These transforms are used to
  supplement a limited syntax.

- To automate the internal linking of the document tree (hyperlink
  references, footnote references, etc.).

- To extract useful information from the document tree. These
  transforms may be used to construct (for example) indexes and tables
  of contents.

Each transform is an optional step that a Docutils Reader may choose to
perform on the parsed document, depending on the input context. A Docutils
Reader may also perform Reader-specific transforms before or after performing
these standard transforms.

writers
-------
This package contains Docutils Writer modules.

Modules in Docutils
===================

__init__.py
-----------

The __init__ module contains base classes and
functions that are inherited in other modules 
throughout the docutils package.

Classes:

- ApplicationError(StandardError): Exception base class for all Docutils-specific exceptions???
- DataError(ApplicationError):???
- SettingsSpec: Runtime settings specification base class.
- TransformSpec: Runtime transform specification base class.
- Component(SettingsSpec, TransformSpec): Base class for Docutils components. A component is a reader, parser, or writer???
