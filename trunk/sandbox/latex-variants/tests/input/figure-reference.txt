How to label and reference a "formal" figure with RST
*****************************************************

And now for something completely different.

HTML optimized
==============

.. _mcicon:

.. figure:: mc.png
   
   Figure 1: Midnight Commander icon
   
`Figure 1`_ shows an icon for the file manager `Midnight Commander`.

LaTeX optimized
================

After defining two custom roles and their expansion in LaTeX, its possible
to utilise LaTeX's reference mechanism.

.. role:: ref

.. role:: label

.. raw::  latex

  \renewcommand*{\docutilsroleref}{\ref}
  \renewcommand*{\docutilsrolelabel}{\label}


.. figure:: mc.png
   :width: 100

   :label:`mc` showsMidnight Commander icon enlarged 
   
Figure :ref:`mc` shows the icon for the file manager `Midnight
Commander` enlarged to a width of 100 Pixel.
