Latex Writer Variants
===============================================

This sandbox project is a place to try out and discuss variants of the
latex2e writer.

Latex writer variants could be:

* enhancements or improvements of the "standard" latex writer, or

* custom latex writers for special needs.

See the `directory listing`__ for already existing writer variants.
Generally, writer specific documentation is placed in the respective writer
source. The `<docs>`_ dir contains more generic documentation.
