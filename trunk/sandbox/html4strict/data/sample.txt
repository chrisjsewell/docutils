:Organization: This is the longest `docinfo` special field name.
:Abstract: Sample text demonstrating the features of the html4strict writer.

	   See the `docs <../docs>`_ dir for layout variants.

Table without hard-coded border
===============================

Simple table with borders\  [#]_:

=====  =====  ======
   Inputs     Output
------------  ------
  A      B    A or B
=====  =====  ======
False  False  False
True   False  True
False  True   True
True   True   True
=====  =====  ======

Borderless table:

.. class:: borderless

=====  =====  ======
   Inputs     Output
------------  ------
  A      B    A or B
=====  =====  ======
False  False  False
True   False  True
False  True   True
True   True   True
=====  =====  ======

.. [#] However, other doctree elements using a table for layout should not be
       given a border.

Field lists as special definition lists
=======================================

The html4strict writer exports field lists as definition lists (with class
`docutils field-list`) and uses CSS to render it "field-list-like".

The various style sheets in the ``sandbox/html4strict/data/`` dir provide
styling examples.

Field list example
-------------------

This list demonstrates the alternatives for the display of field lists
highlighting problems with the handling of long field names:

:The field name:   and value
:this field name:  is considered "long" in the html table rendering.
      	    	   by the html4css1 with the default setting of --field-name-limit=14

		   Therefore, it spans 2 table columns and the field body is
		   pushed to the next line (you can suppress this behaviour
		   with the ``--field-name-limit=0`` option).

:iiiiiiiiiiiiiii:  a field name that is considered "long" by html4css1
		   with the default setting of `field-name-limit: 14`.

:MMMMMMMMMMMMMM:   a field name that is actually longer than the previous
		   one but regarded "short" by html4css1.

:an absolutely very long field name:
		   will be broken at white space in some CSS layout variants.

:an-absolutely-very-long-field-name:
		   with no white space must be handled in a pleasant way.

:last item:	   true love lasts forever and forever and forever and
      		   forever and even longer and so on...
