=====================================================
            The XHTML 1.1 Writer
=====================================================

:Author: Günter Milde
:Date: $Date$
:Abstract: A HTML writer, generating `XHTML 1.1` for styling
           with CSS 2.1.

.. note:: The HTML4Strict writer moved to the Docutils core on 2015-02-20.
          It is called xhtml11 there
          (as the output conforms to http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/).

Introduction
============

State of the art
----------------

  Docutils' default HTML Writer, ``docutils.writers.html4css1`` generates
  output that conforms to the HTML 4.01 Transitional DTD and to the
  Extensible HTML version 1.0 Transitional DTD (*almost* strict).

*Almost*, as it contains some deprecated constructs and "a minimum of
formatting information" in order to ensure correct display with deficient
but (at the time of creation) widespread browsers (mainly IE6).

Objective
----------

Goals of the `xhtml11 writer`:

* Strict standards compliance.

* Generate good looking, readable, and accessible documents.

* Clear distinction of content and layout:

  + Clean HTML output without "hard-coded" visual markup,

  + extended configurability by CSS style sheets.

* `Graceful Degradation
  <http://www.anybrowser.org/campaign/abdesign.html#degradability>`__

* Best viewed with any (CSS2-conforming) HTML browser. [#]_

* Support scientific documents (numbering tables and figures, formal
  tables, ...). Cf. [markschenk]_.


.. [#] Tested with Firefox_, Midori_, Konqueror_ and Opera_. As Safari
   and Google Chrome use the same rendering engine as Midori and
   Konqueror (WebKit), they should work fine as well.

.. _konqueror: http://konqueror.kde.org/

Audience
--------

This writer is for you, if you

* care much about standards compliance,

* care less about the rendering in non-compliant browsers,

* want extended CSS configurability.


Usage
=====

For an example of programmatic use, see the `minimal front end to the
Docutils Publisher, producing valid XHTML 1.1`
<../../docutils/tools/rst2xhtml11.py>`_.

This wrapper can called from the command line (when it is installed in the
BINARY PATH):

Comman line use::

  rst2xhtml11.py [options] [<source> [<destination>]]

The full usage text can be obtained with the ``--help`` option.



Implementation
==============

The writer module subclasses the ``html4css1.Writer`` and
``html4css1.HTMLTranslator`` classes. Some methods are overwritten to
replace deprecated HTML constructs or hard coded formatting.

The xhtml11.css style sheet extends the standard layout for
CSS2-conforming HTML browsers.


Changes to the html4css1 writer
-------------------------------

Document type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

+ The output conforms to the XHTML version 1.1 DTD::

    <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1//EN"
     '"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/DTD/xhtml11.dtd">

  or XHTML + MathML::

    <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1 plus MathML 2.0//EN"
    "http://www.w3.org/Math/DTD/mathml2/xhtml-math11-f.dtd">


Docinfo and field lists based on definition lists (instead of tables)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

+ Reduced loading time for documents with long field lists.

+ Enables CSS styling for:

  - label width (obsoleting the ``--field-name-limit`` option)
  - handling of long labels: truncate, wrap, ...
  - label separator (default: ':')
  - compact vs. open list

Class arguments for docinfo items
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Items in the docinfo list are passed class arguments specifying
their type to enable customization the docinfo layout.

The default style sheet contains example definitions: author and date
are typeset centered and without label, if they occur as first docinfo
fields.


Footnotes and citations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

+ Based on definition lists.

+ Collect adjacent footnotes/citations in one list.

Counter for enumerated lists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A CSS counter for `enumerated lists`_ replaces the deprecated "start"
attribute.

.. _enumerated lists:
   ../../docutils/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#enumerated-lists

+ Enables CSS styling for:

  - label style (including nested numbers),
  - label separator.

The complicated part was to find out a correct CSS rule-set to replicate the
standard behaviour with hanging indent (list-style: "outside"). There is a
`W3C example`_ to number nested list items, however, the result is similar
to 'list-style: inside': subsequent lines start below the label instead of a
hanging indent.

Most Internet resources come to the conclusion that "there’s no
straightforward replacement mechanism" [tekkie]_, "the solution is
buried so deep in CSS2 that there's no point in trying to do it in CSS
for the foreseeable future" [webjunction]_, or "the main point to note
is that there is no direct mapping from the previous behaviour to CSS"
[codelair]_.  `Taming Lists`_ did give valuable advise but no working
complete solution.

The common advise is "Use 'HTML 4.01 Transitional' and keep the START
attribute". [highdots]_, especially, since "There are arguments over
whether the start attribute is presentational or not, and indeed HTML5
has declared that it is no longer deprecated in the current working
drafts (at the time of writing)" [dev.opera]_.

However, a reasonable replacement of 'outside'-styled ordered lists
with CSS is possible:

* The ordered list defines/resets the counter, the automatic numbering
  is suppressed::

    ol {
      counter-reset: item;
      list-style-type: none  ! important;
    }

* The label is defined as "before" pseudo element. The content consists
  of the counter and a separator (by default a trailing dot)::

    ol > li:before {
      counter-increment: item;
      content: counter(item) ".";
    }

* The label is right aligned in a box. Both the label and the list
  content (which Docutils puts in a paragraph node) must be displayed
  as "inline-block" so that they line up::

    ol > li:before {
      display: inline-block;
      vertical-align: top;
      width: 2em;
      padding-right: 0.5em;
      text-align: right;
    }

    ol > li > p { display: inline-block; }

  However, subsequent paragraphs are to be set as nested block
  elements::

    ol > li > p + p {
      display: block;
      margin-top: 0em;
    }

* The hanging indent is realized via a negative "textindent"
  which must be reset for the list content to prevent over-striking::

    ol > li { text-indent: -2.5em; }
    ol > li > p { text-indent: 0em; }

The resulting list can be customized to a large extend

* Different label types and separators are possible, e.g.::

    ol.lowerroman  > li:before {
      content: "(" counter(item, lower-roman) ")";
    }

* nested counters (1, 1.1, 1.1.1, etc)::

    ol.nested > li:before {
      content: counters(item, ".") ". ";
    }

* chapter/section prefix, continued lists, ...

Inline literal role with ``pre-wrap``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In contrast to the html4css1 writer, runs of whitespace are not
replaced by ``&nbsp;`` entities (cf. bug #1938891).

Whitespace-handling and wrapping are configured with the CSS
property ``white-space: pre-wrap``:

  Whitespace is preserved by the browser. Text will wrap when
  necessary, and on line breaks

However, most browsers wrap on non-word chars, too, if set to wrap
at white-space. Text like "--an-option"  or the regular expression
``[+]?(\d+(\.\d*)?|\.\d+)`` may be broken at the wrong place!
The setting ``white-space: pre;`` prevents this, but also
prevents wrapping at white space, contrary to the specification__

In order to allow line-wrap at whitespace only,
words-with-non-word-chars are wrapped in <span>s with class "pre".

+ simpler HTML code

+ White-space handling in inline literals configurable with the CSS
  stylesheet. Possible values: ``normal, nowrap, pre, pre-wrap,
  pre-line``.

__ http://docutils.sf.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#inline-literals


Table styling with CSS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

+ No hard-coded border setting in the table head.

+ Pre-defined table styles selected by class arguments "borderless"
  and "booktabs" matching the interpretation in the latex2e writer.

SimpleListChecker also checks field-lists and docinfo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unified test if a list is compactable:

+ cleaner code

+ also works for nesting field-list in enumeration/bullet-list and
  vice versa

+ also test docinfo, as a field may contain more than one paragraph


Docutils-generated section numbers in a <span>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Instead of hard-coded formatting with trailing ``&nbsp;``,
section numbers in section headings and the toc are placed in spans
with ``class='sectnum'`` and separated from the heading by a CSS rule.

Omit redundant class arguments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Do not  mark the first child with 'class="first"' and the last
child with 'class="last"' in definitions, table cells, field
bodies, option descriptions, and list items. Use the
``:first-child`` and ``:last-child`` selectors instad.

Language attribute name changed to 'xml:lang'
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The name of the language attribute changed from 'lang' in XHTML 1.0 to
'xml:lang' in XHTML 1.1. Documents using 'lang' do not validate.


Do not omit <p> tags
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The HTML4CSS1 writer does this to "produce visually compact lists
(less vertical whitespace)". This writer relies on CSS rules
for"visual compactness".


TODO
----

* The first list in the test `2.3. Enumerated Lists` should be
  compact.

* Hanging indent for numbered section headings and ToC entries.

* search stylesheets along standard path if enclosed in <>
  (like the RST syntax for include files).

* Validate output with "critical" cases not covered by
  the functional test (e.g. headings with level > 6).

* Check, whether we should use the advise from
  http://www.evotech.net/blog/2009/02/css-browser-support/

    To force IE8 to render your page in IE8 compliance mode, include the
    following meta tag::

     <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=8" />

* Move widely supported constructs to the html4css1 writer.

* Number sections with CSS if sectnum_xform is False.

`<../html4trans>`_
  is a similar sandbox project, a HTML writer producing XHTML that
  contains enough formatting information to be viewed without a
  cascading style sheet by a lightweight html browser
  (e.g. `Dillo <http://www.dillo.org>`__ or the console browser
  `elinks <http://elinks.cz>`__).
