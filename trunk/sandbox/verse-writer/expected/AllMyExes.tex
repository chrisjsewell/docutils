\poemtitle{All My Exes}
\begin{verse}
All my exes, how I could care less \\
about your addresses \\
your dogs, your daughters \\
or the state of your kitchen. \\

I will live in the secure orbit \\
of not giving a good God damn \\
about your prescriptions \\
your obsessions, \\
or the color, this week, \\
that you are painting your toes. \\

Family of past loves, \\
envelope your children \\
in thy care. Circle your wagons \\
around them on this night \\
and kindle a fire of distraction. \\
Talk of other dates, \\
other husbands, fiances, lovers, friends. \\

But, when the conversation \\
comes around to me \\
and the sharp barbs have pierced the skin \\
of the old stories \\
associated with my name, \\
please discourage them \\
from seeking me out \\
among the vastness of everybody else. \\

Direct, instead, their attention \\
to \emph{some other} someone. \\
Entreat them to extend that choice phrase \\
that they might have reserved for me \\
to thier new friends and potential exes. \\

Get them away from me. \\
I have a wife to have my coffee with \\
in the morning. I have her name \\
to address my letters to, \\
her jeans to pick up off the carpet \\
when I come home. \\
\end{verse}
