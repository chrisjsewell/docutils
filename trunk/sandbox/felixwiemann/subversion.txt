=======================
 Moving to Subversion?
=======================


Moving from CVS to Subversion would certainly be nice.  This is a
scratchpad for noting down things we have to keep in mind.  Feel free
to add more.


Requirements
============

* Reliable and fast server.

* Anonymous read-only SVN access.

* ViewCVS or ViewSVN.  If that's not supported on-site, remote ViewSVN
  access via CGI script on docutils.sf.net might be possible, too.
  (Though that wouldn't be nice at all.)

* User quota at 100 users at least (currently 63 on SF.net).

* Possibility to add new users without contacting site admin.

* Disk space quota at the very least at 50 MB.  (Currently the SVN
  repository with all sandboxes takes 35 MB; without sandboxes 25 MB.)

* SSH access to the repository at least for admins (for loading
  sandboxes later and for creating backups).

* Commit emails, with the committer's email address and preferably
  also with the committer's real name in From: header.  (I.e., we need
  sendmail or the like, and an easily-accessible user database.)

* Subversion 1.1 server (for FSFS) if developer access is done via SSH
  tunnelling.

* Not-too-long response times for support requests when issues arise
  with the server.

* No shared repository (because of security, backup, and
  migratability).


Hosters
=======

BerliOS
  SF-like.  One issue left:
  https://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?func=detailbug&group_id=1&bug_id=3524

http://www.python-hosting.com/freetracFaq
  Not sure about anonymous access, ViewCVS, and adding users.

Red Bean
  Bill said it might be possible to host Docutils there; I'll ask him
  for details if BerliOS turns out to be unusable.

  Not yet implemented, but maybe soon?
