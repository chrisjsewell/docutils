===============================================
Proposal for a code-block directive in docutils
===============================================

This sandbox project contained experimental code and documentation related to
the proposal for syntax highlight of source code in Docutils.

Since version 0.9, Docutils supports this via the `code` directive and role
and the `code` option of the `include` directive. Most of this project is
moved to the attic.

The documentation in `<docs/syntax-highlight.html>`_ is kept as it
contains ideas for further improvement.

Sample stylesheets are now available in the `<../stylesheets>`_ repository.
