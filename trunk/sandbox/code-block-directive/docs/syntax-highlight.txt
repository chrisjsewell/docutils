:Abstract:  Proposal to add syntax highlight of code blocks to the
            capabilities of Docutils_.

.. sectnum::
.. contents::

Syntax highlighting significantly enhances the readability of code.
Since version 0.9, docutils supports this with a `code` directive and role
as well as a `code` option to the `include` directive using the Pygments_
syntax highlighter.

Example::
  The content of the following directive ::

   .. code:: python

    def my_function():
        "just a test"
        print 8/2

  is parsed and marked up as Python source code. The actual rendering
  depends on the style-sheet.

TODO
====

* TODO: Pygments_ provides filters like VisibleWhitespaceFilter
  add options to use them?


* Use syntax-highlight=long as default and add basic highlight rules
  (keyword, comment, string?) to the default CSS stylesheet to get syntax
  highlight out-of-the-box?
  
  Let the latex2e writer write basic rules in the document preamble if
  "code" is used in the document?
  
* The latex writer should pass the original content and options to a
  ``lstlistings`` environment. with ``--literal-block-env=lstlistings``.

* Check the `odtwriter`, use common syntax and implementation.

* Provide more sample stylesheets in an official stylesheet library.


Configurable literal block directive
------------------------------------

Goal
""""

A clean and simple syntax for highlighted code blocks -- preserving the
space saving feature of the "minimised" literal block marker (``::`` at the
end of a text paragraph). This is especially desirable in documents with
many code blocks like tutorials or literate programs.

Inline analogon
"""""""""""""""

The *role* of inline `interpreted text` can be customised with the
"default-role" directive. This allows the use of the concise "backtick"
syntax for the most often used role, e.g. in a chemical paper, one could
use::

  .. default-role:: subscript

  The triple point of H\ `2`\O is at 0°C.

.. default-role:: subscript

to produce

  The triple point of H\ `2`\O is at 0°C.

This customisation is currently not possible for block markup.

Proposal
""""""""

* Define a new "literal-block" directive syntax for an ordinary literal
  block. This would simply insert the block content into the document
  tree as "literal-block" element.

* Define a "default-literal-block" setting that controls which
  directive is called on a block following ``::``. Default would be the
  "literal-block" directive (backwards compatible).

Motivation
""""""""""

Analogue to customising the default role of "interpreted text" with the
"default-role" directive, the concise ``::`` literal-block markup could be
used for e.g.

* a "code-block" directive for syntax highight

* the "line-block" directive for poems or addresses

* the "parsed-literal" directive

Example::

  ordinary literal block::

     some text typeset in monospace

  .. default-literal-block::  code-block python

  this is colourful Python code::

     def hello():
         print "hello world"


In the same line, a "default-block-quote" setting or directive could be
considered to configure the role of a block quote.
