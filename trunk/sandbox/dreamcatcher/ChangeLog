	* rlpdf/rlpdf.py: Added some options to the Writer. Added
	footnotes, backrefs, topic. Works with docutils/tools/test.txt,
	but the output needs work on the stylesheet.

	* rlpdf/rlpdf.py (Writer.translate): use StringIO as output for
	Reportlab and set the output to the writer output.
	(PDFTranslator.visit_title): Fix weird logic. node.parent['id']
	didn't always existed.
