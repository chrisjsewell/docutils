Docutils DocBook Writer Questions
=================================

Open Issues
===========

* Docutils ``transition`` elements don't seem to have any equivlent in 
  DocBook.  How should these be handled?

* Does DocBook writer need to implement anything for visit & depart
  target? After looking at the HTML generated by Docutils HTML writer &
  DocBook XML converted to HTML using DocBook stylesheets it appears 
  that it doesn't. If it does, I could use a pointer as to what it 
  should be doing.

* Currently, Docutil ``topic`` elements with no classes are treated get 
  mapped to ``section`` elements.  Should this be handled differently?

* Option lists are implemented as a two-column table.  It would be 
  better if it could be implemented using ``cmdsysopsis``.  If not, 
  then "Option" and "Description" should be translated.

* How should Docutils System Messages be handled?  Could generate an 
  appendix or section at the end of the document which contained all 
  system messages handled as ``note`` elements.

* How should ``problematic`` elements be handled?  One idea is to 
  generate a ``remark`` element with a reference to an error message 
  somewhere else in the document.

* Bibliographic/DocInfo elements are the biggest pain the arse!  In 
  order to get a release out, why not just try to display them, instead 
  of mapping them to DocBook elements?  A mixed approach could be to 
  write a separate visitor for DocInfo elements which could collect the 
  data, then the primary writer could use ``author``, ``copyright``, 
  etc... for inclusion in the info section of the generated document, 
  and the rest could be displayed.

* Sidebars are not dispayed nicely using DocBook XSL Stylesheets.  It 
  seems there's not template for sidebarinfo, so the content is 
  displayed.

  My currenct feelings are as follows: that's a DocBook XSL Stylesheet 
  problem.

* Is there a way to recognize inline images? Maybe if an image is in a 
  figure, it shouldn't be inline, otherwise it should?

* DocBook XSL Stylesheets don't seem to respect the ``label`` attribute 
  for footnotes.  Is this a bug with the stylesheets or is it not used?

  Current feelings: that's a DocBook XSL Stylesheet problem.  However, 
  I should look into it.

* Can author element be inserted regardless of whether there is text?
