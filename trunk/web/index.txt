===================================
 Docutils: Documentation Utilities
===================================
---------------------------------------------------------
 Written in Python, for General- and Special-Purpose Use
---------------------------------------------------------

.. This document is *not* meant to be a model for good
   reStructuredText usage.  It is full of external hyperlinks, and
   makes extensive use of anonymous hyperlink syntax, which is not
   easy to follow from the source text.  Please refer to the processed
   HTML instead: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/index.html

The Docutils project is a set of tools for processing plaintext
documentation into useful formats, such as HTML, and LaTeX.  It
includes reStructuredText_, the easy to read, easy to use,
what-you-see-is-what-you-get plaintext markup language.

----------

To **get up & running quickly**, see the Quick-Start_ section of the
README_ file.

.. _Quick-Start: README.html#quick-start

All **documentation** can be reached from the `Docutils Project
Documentation Overview`__.

__ docs/index.html

To the developers of an open source project, **feedback** is a great
motivator and very welcome.  We also rely on feedback for determining
what features to implement.  Thus, if you tell us what you need, you
may just get it!  Please post any feedback to the appropriate `mailing
list`_.

Docutils is in active development and should be considered **highly
experimental**.  We're learning as we go.  APIs are subject to change
at any time.

The only **requirement** for running Docutils is Python_ 2.2 or later.
(Python 2.1 may be used providing the compiler package is installed.
The compiler package can be found in the Tools/ directory of Python's
source distribution.)


Download
========

We recommend you use the latest snapshot, `<docutils-snapshot.tgz>`_.
The snapshots usually contain *more features* and *less bugs* than the
"official" releases |---| they're not only for developers!

Other snapshots (you normally won't need those):

- `Snapshot of the Sandbox`__ (experimental, contributed code; see
  `The Sandbox`_ below for details)
- `Snapshot of DocFactory project files`__ (this is a subset of the
  Sandbox snapshot above; you don't need both)
- `Snapshot of web files`__ (this web site)

.. _latest snapshot: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docutils-snapshot.tgz
__ http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docutils-sandbox-snapshot.tgz
__ http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docfactory-snapshot.tgz
__ http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docutils-web-snapshot.tgz

The latest release package is `docutils-0.3.9.tgz`_.  It is mostly
intended for distributors.  See the `announcement posting`_ for a list
of changes since the previous release (0.3.7).

Mailing Lists
=============

Users who have questions or need assistance with Docutils or
reStructuredText should first check the `Docutils FAQ`_.  If the
question or problem is not answered there, please `post a message`__
to the `Docutils-users mailing list`__ [#docutils-users]_.

Developers can keep up to date and help out by joining the mailing
lists.

High-level discussions take place on the `Python Documentation Special
Interest Group (Doc-SIG) mailing list`__ (email to
Doc-SIG@python.org).

Two lists have been set up specifically for developers of the Docutils
project:

- Docutils-develop__, for implementation discussions
  (email to docutils-develop@lists.sourceforge.net).
- Docutils-checkins__, to monitor change/checkin messages
  (automatically generated; normally read-only).

The Doc-SIG_ has greater exposure and is therefore a better forum for
general discussions (such as reStructuredText syntax or the high-level
Docutils project model), whereas the Docutils-specific lists are more
focused on the implementation.

You can also access the mailing lists via the web (at Gmane):
Docutils-users__, Docutils-develop__, Docutils-checkins__ and
Doc-SIG__.

.. [#docutils-users] Due to overwhelming amounts of spam, the
   docutils-users@lists.sourceforge.net mailing list has been set up
   for subscriber posting only.  Non-subscribers who post to
   docutils-users will receive a message with "Subject: Your message
   to Docutils-users awaits moderator approval".  Legitimate messages
   are accepted and posted as soon as possible (a list administrator
   must verify the message manually).  If you'd like to subscribe to
   docutils-users, please visit
   <http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/docutils-users>.

The Sandbox
===========

The Sandbox__ is a place to play around, to try out and share ideas.
It's a part of the Subversion repository but it isn't distributed as
part of Docutils releases (you can get a recent tarball from the
`development snapshots`_).  Each developer who wants to play in it
should create their own subdirectory (suggested name: SourceForge ID,
or given name + family initial).

Please feel free to `visit the sandbox`__.

It's OK to make a mess in the Sandbox!  But please, play nice.

Sandbox Projects
----------------

Anyone is welcome to contribute to any of these projects.  Interested
developers are welcome to take on any projects which appear to be
dormant.  Please direct any email to
docutils-develop@lists.sourceforge.net.

* ZReST_, by Richard Jones, is a "ReStructuredText Document for Zope"
  application that is complete and ready to install.

* PySource_, by Tony Ibbs, is an experimental Python source Reader.
  In some form, it will soon become part of core Docutils.  There is
  some related code in David Goodger's sandbox (pysource_reader_) and
  a `Python Source Reader <docs/dev/pysource.html>`__ document.

* Docutils interface to PythonPoint_, also by Richard Jones, produces
  PDF presentations using ReportLabs.

* Engelbert Gruber has begun `LaTeX Writer`_ and `ManPage Writer`_ components.

* ? has taken over `ReportLabs/PDF Writer`_ components.

* Oliver Rutherfurd has begun a `DocBook Writer`_ component and
  `HT2HTML integration`_ component.

* Gunnar Schwant's DocFactory_ is a wxPython GUI application for
  Docutils.

* Aahz has begun an `OpenOffice.org Writer`_.

* Ian Bicking is working on code for a Wiki_.

* Bill Bumgarner has written a `simple HTML writer`_ that doesn't rely
  on CSS (stylesheets).

* Beni Cherniavsky has written a generic `preprocessing module`_ for
  roles and/or directives and built preprocessors for TeX math for
  both LaTeX and HTML output on top of it.

* Beni Cherniavsky maintains a Makefile_ for driving Docutils, hoping
  to handle everything one might do with docutils.
