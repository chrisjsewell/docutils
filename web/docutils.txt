 Docutils: Python Documentation Utilities
==========================================

:Date: $Date$

The purpose of the Docutils project is to create a set of tools for
processing plaintext documentation into useful formats, such as HTML,
XML, and TeX.  Several sources will be supported:

- Standalone files.

- Inline documentation from Python modules and packages, extracted
  with namespace context.

- `Python Enhancement Proposals`__ (PEPs).

  __ peps_

- And others as discovered.


Project Status
==============

The Docutils project will be the result of merging the
reStructuredText__ parser into the `Python Docstring Processing
System`__.  The merge is planned but hasn't happened yet.

Docutils is currently just a reStructuredText parser with some extras.
There is a lot of design and implementation work to do, which could
greatly benefit from existing projects.  A joint effort would be very
welcome.

.. Specification
   =============
   
   - `PEP 2xx: reStructuredText Standard Docstring Format`__ proposes a
     standard markup syntax.
   
   - `PEP 257: Docstring Conventions`__ addresses docstring style and
     touches on content.  [`PEP 257`__ in the `master repository`_]
   
   - `PEP 256: Docstring Processing System Framework`__ presents a
     high-level generic processing proposal.  [`PEP 257`__ in the `master
     repository`_]
   
   - `PEP 258: Docutils Design Specification__ documents design issues
     and implementation details for Docutils (this project), a specific
     docstring processing system.  [`PEP 257`__ in the `master repository`_]
