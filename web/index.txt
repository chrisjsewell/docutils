 Docutils: Documentation Utilities

 Written in Python, for General- and Special-Purpose Use

:Date: $Date$

.. Note::

   On 2004-06-02 (Wednesday), we reorganized the project
   documentation.  URL redirection is in place, but if there are any
   broken links or other issues, please notify the `docutils-users
   mailing list <mailto:docutils-users@lists.sourceforge.net>`__.

The purpose of the Docutils project is to create a set of tools for
processing plaintext documentation into useful formats, such as HTML,
XML, and TeX.  Includes reStructuredText_, the easy to read, easy to
use, what-you-see-is-what-you-get plaintext markup language.  Several
sources are or will be supported:

- Standalone files (implemented).
- Inline documentation from Python modules and packages, extracted
  with namespace context.
- `PEPs (Python Enhancement Proposals)`_ (implemented).
- And others as discovered.

Getting Started
===============

To get up & running quickly, see the Quick-Start_ section of the
README_ file.

.. _Quick-Start: README.html#quick-start


Feedback
========

To the developers of an open source project, feedback is a great
motivator and very welcome.  We're working on Docutils in our own way,
pushing it along a more-or-less linear path that makes sense to us,
but may not necessarily be useful to everyone else.  Community
feedback helps steer development in immediately useful directions.

In other words: if you tell us what you need, you may just get it!  If
you really need something, please consider contributing_ to Docutils
in some way.

Please post any feedback to the appropriate `mailing list`_, or `email
the project coordinator`__ directly.

Project Status
==============

The Docutils project began with the merging of the reStructuredText__
parser and the `Python Docstring Processing System`__ projects.  The
merge has been completed, and those projects are now inactive.

__ http://structuredtext.sourceforge.net/
__ http://docstring.sourceforge.net/

Docutils currently consists of a reStructuredText_ parser, readers for
standalone files and PEPs_, and writers for HTML, LaTeX,
Docutils-native XML, plus pseudo-XML for testing purposes.  Writers
for DocBook XML and PDF have been started, and a Python source reader
(docstring extraction with context) is also under way.  There is a lot
of design and implementation work to do, which could greatly benefit
from a joint effort with existing projects.  The project `To Do list`_
is brimming over with ideas.

Docutils is in active development and should be considered highly
experimental.  We're learning as we go.  APIs are subject to change at
any time.

.. _PEPs: `PEPs (Python Enhancement Proposals)`_


Requirements
============

- Python 2.2 or later [#]_ must already be installed to run the code
  and the test suite.  The latest release is recommended.  Python is
  available from http://www.python.org/.

- Docutils uses Greg Ward's Optik_/optparse option processing package.
  It is included in the Docutils distribution.

- The `Python Imaging Library`, or PIL, is used for some image
  manipulation operations if it is installed.

.. [#] Python 2.1 may be used providing the compiler package is
   installed.  The compiler package can be found in the Tools/
   directory of Python's source distribution.

Project Releases
----------------

The `latest project release package`_ (Docutils 0.3.3, 2004-05-09) and
past project releases can be downloaded from the `project files
page`_.  This release fixes many bugs, adds some features, and is
highly recommended over prior versions.

Major changes since Docutils 0.3:

* Added docutils.core.publish_parts convenience function to allow
  access to individual parts of a document; implemented for HTML.

* Added docutils/examples.py: practical examples of Docutils client
  code, to be used as-is or as models for variations.

* Added suppport for more languages: Afrikaans, Czech, Esperanto,
  Brazilian Portuguese, and Russian.  These join the existing
  languages: English, French, German, Italian, Slovak, Spanish, and
  Swedish.

* Reorganized config file format (multiple sections).  Added support
  for ``DOCUTILSCONFIG`` environment variable.

* Additions to reStructuredText:

  - Inline markup parsing for field lists' field names.
  - Support for quoted (and unindented) literal blocks.
  - Directives: table, role.

For a more detailed list of changes, read the `HISTORY of Docutils
0.3.3`__.

Thanks to Felix Wiemann for putting together this release!

Development Snapshots
---------------------

Development snapshots of the project files are available as .tgz
tarballs.  They are generated automatically from CVS, usually within
an hour of a change being checked in.  The snapshots are highly
recommended over the "official" releases, as they contain the latest
features and bug fixes.  However, they may contain transient bugs or
incompatibilities.

- `Snapshot of Docutils code, tests, documentation, and
  specifications`__
- `Snapshot of the Sandbox`__ (experimental, contributed code; see
  `The Sandbox`_ below for details)
- `Snapshot of DocFactory project files`__ (this is a subset of the
  Sandbox snapshot above; you don't need both)
- `Snapshot of web files`__ (the files that generate this web site)

__ http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docutils-snapshot.tgz
__ http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docutils-sandbox-snapshot.tgz
__ http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docfactory-snapshot.tgz
__ http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docutils-web-snapshot.tgz

`Anonymous CVS access`_ is available.  You can also `browse the CVS
repository`_ and read the latest README_, HISTORY_, COPYING_, and FAQ_
files.

Mailing Lists
=============

Users who have questions or need assistance with Docutils or
reStructuredText should first check the `Docutils FAQ`_.  If the
question or problem is not answered there, please `post a message`__
to the `Docutils-users mailing list`__.

Developers can keep up to date and help out by joining the mailing
lists.

High-level discussions take place on the `Python Documentation Special
Interest Group (Doc-SIG) mailing list`__ (email to
Doc-SIG@python.org).

Two lists have been set up specifically for developers of the Docutils
project:

- Docutils-develop__, for implementation discussions
  (email to docutils-develop@lists.sourceforge.net).
- Docutils-checkins__, to monitor CVS checkin messages (automatically
  generated; normally read-only).

The Doc-SIG_ has greater exposure and is therefore a better forum for
general discussions (such as reStructuredText syntax or the high-level
Docutils project model), whereas the Docutils-specific lists are more
focused on the implementation.

You can also access read-only archives of the mailing lists via Gmane:
Docutils-users__, Docutils-develop__, Docutils-checkins__ and
Doc-SIG__.

Documentation
=============

Please see the `Docutils Project Documentation Overview
<docs/index.html>`_.


The Sandbox
===========

The Sandbox__ is a place to play around, to try out and share ideas.
It's a part of the CVS repository but it isn't distributed as part of
Docutils releases (you can get a recent tarball from the `development
snapshots`_).  Each developer who wants to play in it should create
their own subdirectory (suggested name: SourceForge ID, or given name
+ family initial).

Please feel free to `visit the sandbox`__.

It's OK to make a mess in the Sandbox!  But please, play nice.

Sandbox Projects
----------------

Anyone is welcome to contribute to any of these projects.  Interested
developers are welcome to take on any projects which appear to be
dormant.  Please direct any email to
docutils-develop@lists.sourceforge.net.

* ZReST_, by Richard Jones, is a "ReStructuredText Document for Zope"
  application that is complete and ready to install.

* PySource_, by Tony Ibbs, is an experimental Python source Reader.
  In some form, it will soon become part of core Docutils.  There is
  some related code in David Goodger's sandbox (pysource_reader_) and
  a `Python Source Reader <docs/dev/pysource.html>`__ document.

* Docutils interface to PythonPoint_, also by Richard Jones, produces
  PDF presentations using ReportLabs.

* Engelbert Gruber has begun `LaTeX Writer`_ and `ManPage Writer`_ components.

* ? has taken over `ReportLabs/PDF Writer`_ components.

* Oliver Rutherfurd has begun a `DocBook Writer`_ component and
  `HT2HTML integration`_ component.

* Gunnar Schwant's DocFactory_ is a wxPython GUI application for
  Docutils.

* Aahz has begun an `OpenOffice.org Writer`_.

* Ian Bicking is working on code for a Wiki_.

* Bill Bumgarner has written a `simple HTML writer`_ that doesn't rely
  on CSS (stylesheets).

* Beni Cherniavsky has written a generic `preprocessing module`_ for
  roles and/or directives and built preprocessors for TeX math for
  both LaTeX and HTML output on top of it.

* Beni Cherniavsky maintains a Makefile_ for driving Docutils, hoping
  to handle everything one might do with docutils.
