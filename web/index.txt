   reStructuredText usage.  It is full of external hyperlinks, and

.. topic:: DOCUTILS PROJECT COORDINATOR LOOKING FOR WORK

   `The coordinator of the Docutils project, David Goodger, is looking
   for a job, contract work, or consulting work.  Does your company
   need an experienced Python programmer and sysadmin?  Know of
   anybody who does?  Please follow this link for more info.
   <http://starship.python.net/~goodger/cv/>`__
      
The purpose of the Docutils project is to create a set of tools for
processing plaintext documentation into useful formats, such as HTML,
XML, and TeX.  Several sources will be supported:

- Standalone files (implemented).
- Inline documentation from Python modules and packages, extracted
  with namespace context.
- `PEPs (Python Enhancement Proposals)`_ (implemented).
- And others as discovered.

Getting Started
===============

To get up & running quickly, see the Quick-Start_ section of the
README_ file.

.. _Quick-Start: README.html#quick-start


Feedback
========

To the developers of an open source project, feedback is a great
motivator and very welcome.  We're working on Docutils in our own way,
pushing it along a more-or-less linear path that makes sense to us,
but may not necessarily be useful to everyone else.  Community
feedback helps steer development in immediately useful directions.

In other words: if you tell us what you need, you may just get it!  If
you really need something, please consider contributing_ to Docutils
in some way.

Please post any feedback to the appropriate `mailing list`_, or `email
the project coordinator`__ directly.

Project Status
==============

The Docutils project began with the merging of the reStructuredText__
parser and the `Python Docstring Processing System`__ projects.  The
merge has been completed, and those projects are now inactive.

__ http://structuredtext.sourceforge.net/
__ http://docstring.sourceforge.net/

Docutils currently consists of a reStructuredText_ parser, readers for
standalone files and PEPs_, and writers for HTML, LaTeX,
Docutils-native XML, plus pseudo-XML for testing purposes.  Writers
for DocBook XML and PDF have been started, and a Python source reader
(docstring extraction with context) is also under way.  There is a lot
of design and implementation work to do, which could greatly benefit
from a joint effort with existing projects.  The project `To Do list`_
is brimming over with ideas.

This project should be considered highly experimental; we're learning
as we go.  APIs are subject to change at any time.

.. _PEPs: `PEPs (Python Enhancement Proposals)`_


Requirements
------------

- Python 2.2 or later [#]_ must already be installed to run the code
  and the test suite.  The latest release is recommended (currently
  2.2.2).  Python is available from http://www.python.org/.

- Docutils uses Greg Ward's Optik_/optparse option processing package.
  It is included in the Docutils distribution.

.. [#] Python 2.1 may be used providing the compiler package is
   installed.  The compiler package can be found in the Tools/
   directory of Python's source distribution.

.. _Optik: http://optik.sourceforge.net/


Development Snapshots
---------------------

Development snapshots of the project files are available as .tgz
tarballs.  They are generated automatically from CVS, usually within
an hour of a change being checked in.  The snapshots are highly
recommended over the "official" releases, as they contain the latest
features and bug fixes.  However, they may contain transient bugs or
incompatibilities.

- `Snapshot of Docutils code, tests, documentation, and
  specifications`__
- `Snapshot of the Sandbox`__ (experimental, contributed code; see
  `The Sandbox`_ below for details)
- `Snapshot of DocFactory project files`__ (this is a subset of the
  Sandbox snapshot above; you don't need both)
- `Snapshot of web files`__ (the files that generate this web site)

__ http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docutils-snapshot.tgz
__ http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docutils-sandbox-snapshot.tgz
__ http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docfactory-snapshot.tgz
__ http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docutils-web-snapshot.tgz

`Anonymous CVS access`_ is available.  You can also `browse the CVS
repository`_ and read the latest README_, HISTORY_, COPYING_, and FAQ_
files.


Project Releases
----------------

Putting together an official "Release" of Docutils is a significant
effort, so it isn't done that often.  Please note that the
`development snapshots`_ above contain the latest versions of project
files, and are strongly recommended.

The `latest project release package`_ (Docutils 0.3, 2002-06-24) and
past project releases can be downloaded from the `project files
page`_.


.. _mailing list:

Mailing Lists
-------------

Users who have questions or need assistance with Docutils or
reStructuredText should first check the `Docutils FAQ`_.  If the
question or problem is not answered there, please `post a message`__
to the `Docutils-Users mailing list`__.

Developers can keep up to date and help out by joining the mailing
lists.

High-level discussions take place on the `Python Documentation Special
Interest Group (Doc-SIG) mailing list`__ (email to
Doc-SIG@python.org).

Two lists have been set up specifically for developers of the Docutils
project:

- Docutils-develop__, for implementation discussions
  (email to docutils-develop@lists.sourceforge.net).
- Docutils-checkins__, to monitor CVS checkin messages (automatically
  generated; normally read-only).

The Doc-SIG_ has greater exposure and is therefore a better forum for
general discussions (such as reStructuredText syntax or the high-level
Docutils project model), whereas the Docutils-specific lists are more
focused on the implementation.

User Documentation
==================

The latest working documents may be accessed individually below, or
from the ``docs`` directory of the `development snapshots`_ above. 
They are also distributed with the `latest project release package`_,
but those may not be completely up to date.

- `Quick reStructuredText`__ (user reference)
- `Docutils Front-End Tools`__
- `Docutils Configuration Files`__

The Sandbox
===========

The Sandbox__ is a place to play around, to try out and share ideas.
It's a part of the CVS repository but it isn't distributed as part of
Docutils releases (you can get a recent tarball from the `development
snapshots`_).  Each developer who wants to play in it should create
their own subdirectory (suggested name: SourceForge ID, or given name
+ family initial).

Please feel free to `visit the sandbox`__.

It's OK to make a mess in the Sandbox!  But please, play nice.

Sandbox Projects
----------------

Anyone is welcome to contribute to any of these projects.  Interested
developers are welcome to take on any projects which appear to be
dormant.  Please direct any email to
docutils-develop@lists.sourceforge.net.

  application that is complete and ready to install.

* PySource_, by Tony Ibbs, is an experimental Python source Reader. 
  In some form, it will soon become part of core Docutils.  There is
  some related code in David Goodger's sandbox (pysource_reader_) and
  a `Python Source Reader`_ document.

* Docutils interface to PythonPoint_, also by Richard Jones, produces
  PDF presentations using ReportLabs.

* Engelbert Gruber has begun `LaTeX Writer`_ and `ManPage Writer`_ components.

* ? has taken over `ReportLabs/PDF Writer`_ components.

* Oliver Rutherfurd has begun a `DocBook Writer`_ component and
  `HT2HTML integration`_ component.

* Gunnar Schwant's DocFactory_ is a wxPython GUI application for
  Docutils.

* Aahz has begun an `OpenOffice.org Writer`_.

* Ian Bicking is working on code for a Wiki_.

* Bill Bumgarner has written a `simple HTML writer`_ that doesn't rely
  on CSS (stylesheets).
