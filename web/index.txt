 Docutils: Python Documentation Utilities
==========================================

:Date: $Date$

.. contents::

The purpose of the Docutils project is to create a set of tools for
processing plaintext documentation into useful formats, such as HTML,
XML, and TeX.  Several sources will be supported:

- Standalone files (implemented).
- Inline documentation from Python modules and packages, extracted
  with namespace context.
- `Python Enhancement Proposals`__ (PEPs).
- And others as discovered.

Feedback
========

To the developers of an open source project, feedback is a great
motivator and very welcome.  We're working on Docutils in our own way,
pushing it along a more-or-less linear path that makes sense to us,
but may not necessarily be useful to everyone else.  Community
feedback helps steer development in immediately useful directions.

In other words: if you tell us what you need, you may just get it!  If
you really need something, please consider contributing__ to Docutils
in some way.

Please post any feedback to the appropriate `mailing list`_, or `email
me`__ directly.

Project Status
==============

The Docutils project began with the merging of the reStructuredText__
parser and the `Python Docstring Processing System`__ projects.  The
merge has been completed, and those projects are now inactive.

__ http://structuredtext.sourceforge.net/
__ http://docstring.sourceforge.net/

Docutils is currently just a reStructuredText parser with some extras.
There is a lot of design and implementation work to do, which could
greatly benefit from a joint effort with existing projects.

This project should be considered highly experimental; we're learning
as we go.  APIs are subject to change at any time.


Daily Snapshots
---------------

Daily snapshots of the project files are available.  They are
generated automatically from CVS around midnight in North America's
Eastern time zone (UTC-0400 from April to October, UTC-0500 from
October to April).  The snapshots should be used with caution, as they
may contain transient bugs or incompatibilities.

- `Snapshot of Docutils code, tests, documentation, and
  specifications`__
- `Snapshot of the Sandbox`__ (experimental, contributed code; see
  `The Sandbox`_ below for details)
- `Snapshot of web files`__ (the files that generate this web site)

__ http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docutils-snapshot.tgz
__ http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docutils-sandbox-snapshot.tgz
__ http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docutils-web-snapshot.tgz

`Anonymous CVS access`_ is available.  You can also `browse the CVS
repository`_ and read the latest README_ and HISTORY_ files.


Project Releases
----------------

Please note that the `daily snapshots`_ above contain the latest
versions of project files, although they may not be fully tested.

The `latest project release package`_ (Docutils 0.1, 2002-04-20) and
past project releases can be downloaded from the `project files
page`_.


.. _mailing list:

Mailing Lists
-------------

You can keep up to date and help out by joining the mailing lists.

High-level discussions take place on the `Python Documentation Special
Interest Group (Doc-SIG) mailing list`__ (email to
Doc-SIG@python.org).

Two lists have been set up specifically for the Docutils project:

- `docutils-develop`__, for development discussions
  (email to docutils-develop@lists.sourceforge.net).
- `docutils-checkins`__, for CVS checkin messages (normally
  read-only).

The Doc-SIG_ has greater exposure and is therefore a better forum for
general discussions (such as reStructuredText syntax or the high-level
Docutils project model), whereas the Docutils-specific lists are more
focused on the implementation.

User Documentation
==================

The latest working documents may be accessed individually below, or
from the ``docs`` directory of the `daily snapshots`_ above.  They are
also distributed with the `latest project release package`_, but these
may not be completely up to date.

- `A ReStructuredText Primer`__ (HTML file, or `text source`__)
- `Quick reStructuredText`__ (user reference)

Specification
=============

PEPs (Python Enhancement Proposals)
-----------------------------------

- `PEP 287: reStructuredText Standard Docstring Format`__ proposes a
  standard markup syntax.  [`PEP 287`__ in the `master repository`_]
- `PEP 257: Docstring Conventions`__ addresses docstring style and
  touches on content.  [`PEP 257`__ in the `master repository`_]
- `PEP 256: Docstring Processing System Framework`__ presents a
  high-level generic processing proposal.  [`PEP 256`__ in the `master
  repository`_]
- `PEP 258: Docutils Design Specification`__ documents design issues
  and implementation details for Docutils (this project), a specific
  docstring processing system.  [`PEP 258`__ in the `master
  repository`_]

Please note that PEPs in the `master repository`_ may not be current,
whereas the local versions are.

The Sandbox
===========

The Sandbox__ is a place to play around, to try out and share ideas.
It's a part of the CVS repository but it isn't distributed as part of
Docutils releases (you can get a recent tarball from the `daily
snapshots`_).  Each developer who wants to play in it should create
their own subdirectory (suggested name: SourceForge ID, or given name
+ family initial).

Please feel free to `visit the sandbox`__.

It's OK to make a mess in the Sandbox!  But please, play nice.
