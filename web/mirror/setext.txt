 Setext Documents Mirror
=========================

Here are `local copies of some Setext documents`__.

__
.. _Setext mirror: setext/

The original Setext (structure-enhanced text) source was
http://www.bsdi.com/setext/, but it seems to have disappeared from the
Web.  The files in the "`Setext mirror`_" are all the files relating
to Setext that I have (including `a tarball of the lot`__).

__ setext/setext.tgz

I have not been able to locate the originators of Setext, Ian Feldman
or Tony Sanders.  If you know how to contact them, or if you know of
an official repository for the Setext documents, please `inform me`__.
