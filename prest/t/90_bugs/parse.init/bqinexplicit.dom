        <paragraph>
            From RFC 2396 (URI syntax):
        <block_quote>
            <paragraph>
                The angle-bracket "<" and ">" and double-quote (")
                characters are excluded [from URIs] because they are often
                used as the delimiters around URI in text documents and
                protocol fields.
