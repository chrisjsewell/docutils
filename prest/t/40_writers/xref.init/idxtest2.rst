This is another test file for the index writer. It contains many definitions
from `The New Hacker's Dictionary <http://catb.org/esr/jargon/html/>`_, aka
Jargon File.

Terms starting with Numbers
============================

Terms starting with 4
---------------------

_`404` 
  [from the HTTP error "file not found on server"] Extended to humans
  to convey that the subject has no idea or no clue - sapience not
  found. May be used reflexively; "Uh, I'm 404ing" means "I'm drawing a
  blank".


_`404 compliant` *adj.*
  The status of a website which has been completely removed, usually
  by the administrators of the hosting site as a result of net abuse by
  the website operators. The term is a tongue-in-cheek reference to the
  standard "301 compliant" Murkowski Bill disclaimer used by
  spammers. See also: `spam`_, `spamvertize`_.



Terms starting with Letters
============================

Terms starting with 'C'
-----------------------

_`canonical`
  It takes many words to explain this term. Please
  see http://catb.org/esr/jargon/html/entry/canonical.html.


Terms starting with 'H'
-----------------------

_`hosed` **adj.**
  You shouldn't miss `this one 
  <http://catb.org/esr/jargon/html/entry/hosed.html>`_.

_`hacker ethic`
  There is really `a lot 
  <http://catb.org/esr/jargon/html/entry/hacker-ethic.html>`_ to say about this.

Terms starting with 'I'
-----------------------

.. _I only renamed a variable!: `I didn't change anything!`_
  
_`I didn't change anything!` :subscript:`interj`

  An aggrieved cry often heard as bugs manifest during a regression
  test. The `canonical`_ reply to this assertion is "Then it works just
  the same as it did before, doesn't it?" See also `one-line fix`_. This
  is also heard from applications programmers trying to blame an
  obvious applications problem on an unrelated systems software
  change, for example a divide-by-0 fault after terminals were added
  to a network. Usually, their statement is found to be false. Upon
  close questioning, they will admit some major restructuring of the
  program that shouldn't have broken anything, in their opinion, but
  which actually `hosed`_ the code completely.

Terms starting with 'O'
-----------------------

_`one-line fix` `n.`
  Used (often sarcastically) of a change to a program that is thought
  to be trivial or insignificant right up to the moment it crashes the
  system. Usually 'cured' by another one-line fix. See also `I didn't
  change anything!`_

Terms starting with 'R'
-----------------------

_`rabbit job` `n.`:sup:
  [Cambridge] A batch job that does little, if any, real work, but
  creates one or more copies of itself, breeding like rabbits.

_`README file` [1]_
  Hacker's-eye introduction traditionally included in the top-level
  directory of a Unix source distribution, containing a pointer to
  more detailed documentation, credits, miscellaneous revision
  history, notes, etc. (The file may be named README, or READ.ME, or
  rarely ReadMe or readme.txt or some other variant.) In the Mac and
  PC worlds, software is not usually distributed in source form, and
  the README is more likely to contain user-oriented material like
  last-minute documentation changes, error workarounds, and
  restrictions. When asked, hackers invariably relate the README
  convention to the famous scene in Lewis Carroll's "Alice's
  Adventures In Wonderland" in which Alice confronts magic munchies
  labeled "Eat Me" and "Drink Me".

.. [1] A footnote.

Terms starting with 'S'
-----------------------

_`Share and enjoy!`
  1. Commonly found at the end of software release announcements and `README
     file`_\ s, this phrase indicates allegiance to the hacker ethic of free 
     information sharing (see `hacker ethic`_, sense 1). 
  2. The motto of the complaints division of Sirius Cybernetics Corporation 
     (the ultimate gaggle of incompetent suits) in Douglas Adams's "`Hitch
     Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy`__". The irony of using this as a cultural 
     recognition signal appeals to hackers.

_`spam`
  The definition of this term is really long in the Jargon File. Please 
  see `here <http://catb.org/esr/jargon/html/entry/spam.html>`_.

_`spamvertize` `v.`:inline:
  To advertise using `spam`_. Pejorative.
