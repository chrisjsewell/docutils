Release 0.3.11
--------------
General changes:

* Restructured to be compatible with CPAN and to use the
  officially-designated Text::Restructured namespace.
* Released under Perl license (combination of GPL and Artistic
  License) instead of GPL alone.
* Removed all run-time globals from Text::Restructured.pm and placed
  them in a parser object.
* Reworked the tests to use the perl test harness.

``prest`` script:

* Fixed a problem that occurred when running with ``-T`` (taint) flag.
* Added section headers to usage help for plug-in directives and writers.

reStructuredText parser:

* Changed to an object-oriented implementation.
* Made package-global constant strings unmodifiable.
* Transforms now take the parser object as a second argument.
* Now infers alignment in simple tables for multi-line entries based on
  the first row's alignment (unless ``-D align=0``).

reStructuredText transforms:

* Transforms now take the parser object as a second argument.

Plug-in directives 'if', 'perl', and 'system':

* Code now has access to the ``$^A`` to ``$^Z`` variables in the safe box.

Writers were all modified to use private space within the DOM objects
for their particular annotations.

Writer 'html':

* Changed stylesheet embedding so that URL and embedded stylesheets
  can be specified independently for the same document.  It also now
  automatically embeds the stylesheet from the distribution if no URL
  is specified.
* Added the ``-W colspecs`` option.

Writer 'latex':

* Fixed a problem with multiple initializations.
* Fixed quoting in parsed literals.
* Fixed problem with footer sometimes returning an undefined string.
