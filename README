1. Run ::

     perl Makefile.PL

   and answer the questions.

2. Then do

     make
     make test
     make doc
     make install

3. Help for the prest program can be gotten by doing "prest -h".  The
   complete documentation for reStructuredText and what prest supports
   gets built in the doc/html subdirectory, but is not installed
   automatically.
