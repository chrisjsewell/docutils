Doctils DocBook Writer ChangeLog
================================

2004-03-22
----------

* general tidying & bugfixes

2003-07-21
----------

* ``title`` element placed before ``{doctype}info`` element.


2003-07-19
----------

* Added support for ``address``, ``admonition``, ``attribution``, 
  ``dedication`` (topic class), ``subscript``, ``superscript``, 
  and ``rubric`` [#]_ elments.

* Changed ``title_reference`` mapping from ``emphasis`` to ``citetitle``.

* Character in attribute names & values >= 128, are encoded as numeric
  entities (that might not be the correct name).  Here's what I mean::

  	chr(128) -> &#128;

  I added this becuase converting "tools\test.txt" failed on input line 303.
  The attribute value for the label was ``u'\u2020'``.

* Removed insertion of `` : `` from ``visit_classifier``.  There was
  discussion on one of the docutils lists that the writers should not be
  inserting anything.

* If the parent element of an image is a paragraph, it maps to
  ``inlinemediaobject``, otherwise as ``mediaobject``.

* Using DocBook 4.2 instead of DocBook 4.

.. [#] `rubric` is mapped to `bridgehead`, which seemed to be the best 
   match. However, I've never heard of either of these, so it's just a 
   best guess.
