DocFactory is a kind of *integrated publishing environment* for
documentation, tied to |Docutils|.  In fact, the intention of
DocFactory is to be a GUI for |Docutils|.  At present it can be used
to edit a set of one or more |ReST| files simultaneously
and publish them as HTML.  Support for other markups and output
formats is planned for future releases. `Read more...`__
