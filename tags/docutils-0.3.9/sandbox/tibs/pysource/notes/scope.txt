On finding names
================

We are not trying for a general solution to the problem of "find the item
that is being referred to" - we are just trying to provide useful links
between <interpreted> items in docstrings and those things that they
might reasonably be expected to be referring to.

Some rules thus occur.

1. We will not show attributes, docstring or not, if they are not

   a. At module level (so a ModuleValue)
   b. Within a class (so a ClassValue)
   c. Within a method called __init__ or __new__.

   So discard any attributes that do not match these criteria.

Hmm - is that the only rule? Can it be so simple?
