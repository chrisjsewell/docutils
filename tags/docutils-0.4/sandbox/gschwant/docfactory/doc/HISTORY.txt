 DocFactory History
=====================

.. If you have downloaded this file as part of the 
   DocFactory-tarball, please use docutils to convert
   it to HTML and open index.html with your webbrowser.

DocFactory 0.3 (2004/05/07)
  * Changed the **Project Settings** dialog: The new version allows
    you to edit docutils.conf-files in a more flexible way.  You can
    add/edit/remove any kind of sections/options/values by yourself.
    As more and more docutils settings become available, this seems
    to be a much better solution than the former dialog.  To put it
    into a nutshell:  DocFactory is prepared for the new Docutils
    configuration file format now.  (I know, it's not that new 
    anymore ...)

DocFactory 0.2.6 (2004/04/03)
