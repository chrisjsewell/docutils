=================

* reStructuredText:

  - Allow length units for all length specifications.
  - Allow percent sign in "scale" argument of "figure" and "image" directives.
  - Bugfix: The "figalign" argument of a figure now works as intended
    (aligning the figure not its contents).
  - Align images with class "align-[right|center|left]"
    (allows setting the alignment of an image in a figure).

* HTML writer:

  - ``--stylesheet`` and ``--stylesheet-path`` options now support a comma
    separated list of stylesheets.

    do not convert ``px`` to ``pt``.

  - Load packages and define macros only if required in the document.
  - All Docutils specific LaTeX macros are prefixed with ``DU``.

  - If 'sectnum_xform' is False, the 'sectnum' directive triggers
    section numbering by LaTeX.
