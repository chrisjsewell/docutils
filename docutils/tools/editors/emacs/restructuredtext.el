;; Support code for editing reStructuredText with Emacs indented-text mode.
;; The goal is to create an integrated reStructuredText editing mode.
;;
;; Installation instructions
;; -------------------------
;;
;; You should bind the versatile sectioning command to some key in the text-mode
;; hook. Something like this::
;;
;;   (defun user-rst-mode-hook ()
;;     (local-set-key [(control ?=)] 'rest-adjust-section-title)
;;     )
;;   (add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'user-rst-mode-hook)
;;
;; Other specialized and more generic functions are also available.
;; Note that C-= is a good binding, since it allows you to specif a negative arg
;; easily with C-- C-= (easy to type), as well as ordinary prefix arg with
;; C-u C-=.

;;
;; The following functions implement a smart automatic title sectioning feature.
;; The idea is that with the cursor sitting on a section title, we try to get as
;; much information from context and do the best thing. This function can be
;; invoked many time and/or with prefix argument to rotate between the various
;; options.
;;
;; There are two styles of sectioning:
;;
;; 1. simple-underline, e.g.      |Some Title
;;                                |----------
;;
;; 2. overline-and-underline, e.g.  |------------
;;                                  | Some Title
;;                                  |------------
;;
;; Some notes:
;;
;; - the underlining character that is used depends on context. The file is
;;   scanned to find other sections and an appropriate character is selected.
;;   If the function is invoked on a section that is complete, the character
;;   is rotated among the existing ones.
;;
;; - prefix argument is used to alternate the sectioning style.
;;
;; Examples:
;;
;;   |Some Title       --->    |Some Title
;;   | 			       |----------
;;
;;   |Some Title       --->    |Some Title
;;   |----- 		       |----------
;;
;;   |                         |------------
;;   | Some Title      --->    | Some Title
;;   | 			       |------------
;;
;; In overline-and-underline style, a variable is available to select how much
;; space to leave before and after the title (it can be zero) when alternating
;; the style.  Note that if the title already has some whitespace in front of
;; it, we don't adjust it to the variable setting, we use the whitespace that is
;; already there for adjustment.

(defun rest-adjust-section-title ()
  "Adjust/rotate the section underlining for the section around
  point.

  This function is the main entry point of this module and is a
  bit of a swiss knife.  It is meant as the single function to
  invoke to adjust the underlines (and possibly overlines) of a
  section title in restructuredtext.  The next action it takes
  depends on context around the point, and it is meant to be
  invoked possibly more than once. Basically, this function deals
  with:

  - underlining a title if it does not have an underline;
  - adjusting the length of the underline characters to fit a
    modified title;
  - rotating the underlines/overlines in the set of already
    existing underline chars used in the file;
  - switching between simple underline and over-and-under style
    sectioning (or box style).

  Here are the gory details:

  - If the current line has no underline character around it,
    search backwards for a previously used underlining character,
    and underline the current line as a section title (also see
    prefix argument below).

    If no pre-existing underlining character is found in the
    file, we use the last seen underline char or
    rest-default-section-char if this is the first title in the
    entire file.

  - If the current line does have an underline or overline, and
    if

    - the underline do not extend to exactly the end of the
      title line, this changes the length of the under(over)lines
      to fit exactly the section title;

    - the underline length is already adjusted to the end of the
      title line, we search the file for the underline chars, and
      we rotate the current title's underline character with that
      list (going down the hierarchy that is present in the
      file);

    If there is a prefix argument, switch the style between the
    initial sectioning style and the other sectioning style.  The
    two styles are overline-and-underline and simple-underline.
    
    If however, you are on a complete section title and you
    specify a negative argument, the effect of the prefix
    argument is to change the direction of rotation of the
    underline characters. Thus using a prefix argument and a
    negative prefix argument achieves a different result in the
    case of rotation.

    Note that the initial style of underlining (simple underline
    or box-style) depends on if there is whitespace at the start
    of the line.  If there are already underlines/overlines,
    those are used to select the style, otherwise if there is
    whitespace at the front of the title overline-and-underline
    style is chosen, and otherwise simple underline.

    Also, note that this should work on the section title line as
    well as on a complete or incomplete underline for a
    title (first thing we check for that case and move the cursor
    up a line if needed)."
