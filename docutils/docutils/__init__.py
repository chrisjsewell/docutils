"""
This is the Docutils (Python Documentation Utilities) package.

Package Structure
=================

Modules:

- __init__.py: Contains the package docstring only (this text).

- core.py: Contains the ``Publisher`` class and ``publish()`` convenience
  function.

- frontend.py: Command-line and common processing for Docutils front-ends.

- io.py: Provides a uniform API for low-level input and output.

- nodes.py: Docutils document tree (doctree) node class library.

- statemachine.py: A finite state machine specialized for
  regular-expression-based text filters.

- urischemes.py: Contains a complete mapping of known URI addressing
  scheme names to descriptions.

- utils.py: Contains the ``Reporter`` system warning class and miscellaneous
  utilities.

Subpackages:

- languages: Language-specific mappings of terms.

- parsers: Syntax-specific input parser modules or packages.

- readers: Context-specific input handlers which understand the data
  source and manage a parser.

- transforms: Modules used by readers and writers to modify DPS
  doctrees.

- writers: Format-specific output translators.

"""``major.minor.micro`` version number.  The micro number is bumped any time
there's a change in the API incompatible with one of the front ends.  The
minor number is bumped whenever there is a project release.  The major number
will be bumped when the project is complete, and perhaps if there is a major
change in the design."""
