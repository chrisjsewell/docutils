Tests for the LaTeX writer
==========================

Test syntax elements which may cause trouble for the LaTeX writer but might
not need to be tested with other writers (e.g. the HTML writer).

.. include:: data/custom_roles_latex.txt
.. include:: data/option_lists.txt
.. include:: data/nonalphanumeric.txt
.. include:: data/unicode.txt
.. unusual combinations (from newlatex, should we test them)
   .. include:: data/latex.txt

.. end of the special tests for the LaTeX writer

.. include:: data/errors.txt
