Custom Roles in LaTeX
---------------------

* Role names and class arguments are are converted to conform to the regular
  expression ``[a-z][-a-z0-9]*`` (all non-conforming characters are replaced
  by a hyphen, all letters are downcased).

  Class arguments may contain numbers and hyphens, which need special
  treatment in LaTeX command names.

  .. role:: custom4
     :class: large custom4 small_caps custom.role custom\role

  :custom4:`Interpreted Text`


* With LaTeX, roles can be styled within the document using the `raw`
  directive.

  .. raw:: latex

    \newcommand{\docutilsrolelarge}[1]{{\large #1}}
    \makeatletter
    \@namedef{docutilsrolesmall-caps}{\textsc}
    \@namedef{docutilsrolecustom4}{\textbf}
    \makeatother

  :custom4:`Interpreted Text` in large, bold, small-caps.
