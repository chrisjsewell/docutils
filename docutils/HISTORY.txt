Changes Since 0.2
========================

General:

* Renamed "attribute" to "option" for directives/extensions.

* Renamed transform method "transform" to "apply".

* Renamed "options" to "settings" for runtime settings (as set by
  command-line options).  Sometimes "option" (singular) became
  "settings" (plural).  Some variations below:

  - document.options -> document.settings (stored in other objects as
    well)
  - option_spec -> settings_spec (not directives though)
  - OptionSpec -> SettingsSpec
  - cmdline_options -> settings_spec

Release 0.2 (2002-07-31)
========================

General:

- The word "component" was being used ambiguously.  From now on,
  "component" will be used to mean "Docutils component", as in Reader,
  Writer, Parser, or Transform.  Portions of documents (Table of
  Contents, sections, etc.)  will be called "document parts".
- Did a grand renaming: a lot of ``verylongnames`` became
  ``very_long_names``.
- Cleaned up imports: no more relative package imports or
  comma-separated lists of top-level modules.
- Added support for an option values object which carries default
  settings and overrides (from command-line options and library use).
- Added internal Unicode support, and support for both input and
  output encodings.
- Added support for the ``docutils.io.IO`` class & subclasses.

Specific:

* docutils/__init__.py:

    command-line support.
  - Added ``Publisher.process_command_line()`` and ``.set_options()``
    methods.
  - Reworked I/O model for ``docutils.io`` wrappers.
  - Updated ``Publisher.set_options()``; now returns option values
    object.
  - Added support for configuration files (/etc/docutils.conf,
    ./docutils.conf, ~/.docutils).
  - Added ``Publisher.setup_option_parser()``.
  - Added default usage message and description.

* docutils/frontend.py: Added to project; support for front-end
  (command-line) scripts.  Option specifications may be augmented by
  components.  Requires Optik (http://optik.sf.net/) for option
  processing (installed locally as docutils/optik.py).

  output mechanisms.

  - Added ``Element.set_class()`` method (sets "class" attribute).

  package, with added option groups and other modifications.  The use
  of this module is probably only temporary.

* docutils/statemachine.py:

  - Added ``runtime_init`` method to ``StateMachine`` and ``State``.
  - Added underscores to improve many awkward names.

  - Added ``-/:`` characters to inline markup's start string prefix,
    ``/`` to end string suffix.
