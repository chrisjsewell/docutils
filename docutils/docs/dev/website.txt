The Docutils web site, <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/>, is
maintained by the ``docutils-update`` script.  The script used to run
as a cron job, but since mid-2004, cron isn't working on
SourceForge.net, so you will have to run it manually.  It will process
any .txt file which is newer than the corresponding .html file in the
project's web directory on SourceForge
(``/home/groups/d/do/docutils/htdocs/``).  For a new .txt file, just
SSH to ``<username>@shell.sourceforge.net`` and ::

    touch filename.html
    chmod g+w filename.html
    sleep 1
    touch filename.txt
    /home/groups/d/do/docutils/snapshots/sandbox/davidg/infrastructure/docutils-update -p

The ``docutils-update`` script will retrieve the most current version
of the .txt file from CVS and generate the .html file.  Thereafter
whenever the .txt file is modified (checked in to CVS), the .html will
be regenerated when ``docutils-update`` is run.

After adding directories to CVS, allow the script to run once to
create the directories in the filesystem before preparing for HTML
processing as described above.

The docutils-update__ script is in CVS as
``sandbox/davidg/infrastructure/docutils-update``.
