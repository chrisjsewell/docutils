Assumptions and their failure
-----------------------------

On the test machine python2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7 and 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4
are installed.
Some in /usr/ some under /usr/local.

Assumption: If python2.6 is in /usr/bin/ than site-packages is under
  /usr/local/lib/python2.6.

On new ubuntu 12.10

* python2.7 is here /usr/bin/python2.7.
* in /usr/lib are python2.7, pymodules and pyshared.

  in /usr/lib/python2.7 no site-packages directory even after installation
  of docutils

  in /usr/local/lib/python2.7 are dist-packages  site-packages.

  site-packages is empty.

  docutils is installed under dist-packages.

  pymodules has a python2.7 directory.

Releasing
---------

Version numbers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Version numbers shall follow the `Docutils Project Policies`_ and comply
with `PEP 440`_.

From `Feature Request #50`_

  PEP 440 specifies how release version are understood by pip and other tools.

  The last released package of docutils was in 2014.

  If you install the version from Source it will not be overriden by version
  0.13 when it is eventaully released.

  As folks have installed 0.13 from indeterminate source versions the current
  version should be incremented as to allow pip to overrite a 0.13 snapshot
  when the next official release.

  Please increment and switch the version in setup.py to be a pre-release.
  e.g. 0.13.1a

  When a version is tagged it should be changed to a non pre release and then
  in the next commit incremented to the next expected version but with a pre
  release added ::

    0.13.1a -> Head
    0.13.1 -> when tagged for release
    0.13.2a -> new head after release

  Additionally snapshots can be marked with the .devXXX nomenclature.

  These can then all be pushed to pypi.python.org and by default pip will
  install the latest release unless explicitly requested via the ``--pre``
  flag or a version specifier ``docutils>=0.13.1a``

Release steps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

REWORK FOR SOURCEFORGE REPO


.. WARNING:: Steps in boldface text are *not* covered by the release script
   at sandbox/infrastructure/release.sh.  "Not covered" means that you
   aren't even reminded of them.

.. Note:: This document does not cover branching and tagging, but the
   release script does.

.. Note:: You may want to use ReleaseForge_ instead of using
   SourceForge's file release system.

   .. _ReleaseForge: http://releaseforge.sourceforge.net/


* **On the Docutils-develop mailing list, announce that the release is
  going to be made, update the release notes and ask for additions.**

  Consult HISTORY.TXT for changes.

* **Announce a check-in freeze on Docutils-develop.**

* **Announce the upcoming release at the Sphinx-devel mailing list
  and ask for testing with Sphinx.**
  (This step can be skipped for bugfix releases.)

* Call ``sandbox/infrastructure/release.sh new_version svn_version``.
  For details see the script.

  ``new_version`` is the current version, status will change from
  ``repository`` to ``release``. ``svn_version`` is the version after
  release.

  .. Note:: *BUG* test tarball requires root password, but it is possible to
     skip this stage interactively, and testing should be done before
     release.

* Change ``__version_details__`` in docutils/docutils/__init__.py to
  "release" (from "repository").

* Check the _`version number` in the following files, should be already
  correct:

  + docutils/setup.py
  + docutils/docutils/__init__.py
  + docutils/test/functional/expected/* ("Generator: Docutils X.Y.Z")
  + docutils/README.txt
  + web/index.txt

* Close the "Changes Since ..." section in docutils/HISTORY.txt.

* Clear/unset the PYTHONPATH environment variable.

* Create the release tarball:

  (a) Create a new empty directory and ``cd`` into it.

  (b) Get a clean snapshot of the main tree::

          svn export svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/docutils/code/trunk/docutils

      or via the [Download Snapshot] button at
      http://sourceforge.net/p/docutils/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/docutils/

  (c) Use Distutils to create the release tarball::

          cd docutils
          python setup.py sdist

* Expand and _`install` the release tarball in isolation:

  (a) Expand the tarball in a new location, not over any existing
      files.

  (b) Remove the old installation from site-packages (including
      roman.py, and optparse.py, textwrap.py).

      "remove" might fail, see _`Assumptions and their failure`

      Install from expanded directory::

          cd docutils-X.Y.Z
          python setup.py install

      The "install" command may require root permissions.

  (c) Repeat step b) for all supported Python versions.

* Run the _`test suite` from the expanded archive directory with all
  supported Python versions on all available platforms (GNU/Linux, Mac
  OS X, Windows)::

      cd test ; python -u alltests.py

* Add a directory X.Y.Z (where X.Y.Z is the current version number
  of Docutils) in the webroot (i.e. the ``htdocs/`` directory).
  Put all documentation files into it::

      cd docutils-X.Y.Z
      rm -rf build
      cd tools/
      ./buildhtml.py ..
      cd ..
      find -name test -type d -prune -o -name \*.css -print0 \
          -o -name \*.html -print0 -o -name \*.txt -print0 \
          | tar -cjvf docutils-docs.tar.bz2 -T - --null
      scp docutils-docs.tar.bz2 <username>@shell.sourceforge.net:

  Now log in to shell.sourceforge.net and::

      cd /home/groups/d/do/docutils/htdocs/
      mkdir -m g+rwxs X.Y.Z
      cd X.Y.Z
      tar -xjvf ~/docutils-docs.tar.bz2
      rm ~/docutils-docs.tar.bz2

* Upload the release tarball, release.sh tries with scp.

* Access the _`file release system` on SourceForge (Admin
  interface).

  ``https://sourceforge.net/projects/docutils/files/docutils/``

  * change into the released version's directory
  * click ``(i)`` button of the tar.gz-file
  * select as default download for all operating systems.

* Submit a notification on project news.

* For verifying the integrity of the release, download the release
  tarball (you may need to wait up to 30 minutes), install_ it, and
  re-run the `test suite`_.

* Register with PyPI (``python setup.py register``).

  Set the download-url so eggs can access older releases.

* Restore ``__version_details__`` in docutils/docutils/__init__.py to
  "repository" (from "release").

* Bump the `version number`_ again.

* Add a new empty section "Changes Since ..." in HISTORY.txt.

* Update the web page (web/index.txt).

* Run docutils-update on the server.

* **Run alltests.py with svn version**

* **build wheels**::

    pip wheel docutils
    pip3 wheel docutils

  This builds wheels_ (`pure Python wheels`_ for Python 2 and 3
  respectively) by downloading the new release from pypi.

  `Upload the wheels to PyPI`_.

  Question: Can we have an tar.gz (distutil) and a py2-wheel and a py3-wheel
    on pypi and will installers select the correct files ?

* **Send announcement email to:**

  * docutils-develop@lists.sourceforge.net (also announcing the end of
    the check-in freeze)
  * docutils-users@lists.sourceforge.net
  * doc-sig@python.org
  * python-announce@python.org

* **Add a SourceForge News item, with title "Docutils X.Y.Z released"
  and containing the release tarball's download URL.**

  **Mark as default download for all platforms.**

* **Register with freecode.** Add a new release for the
  `Docutils project`__. (freecode is freshmeat.net's new name)
