================

These are projects users of Docutils and reStructuredText may find
useful.  Many of them projects are hosted in the `Docutils Sandbox`_.
All projects are usable by end users in some way, however do not
expect all of them to run out of the box.

* rest2web_, by Michael Foord, is a tool for creating web sites with
  reStructuredText.

* ZReST_, by Richard Jones, is a "ReStructuredText Document for Zope"
  application that is complete and ready to install.

* PySource_, by Tony Ibbs, is an experimental Python source Reader.
  In some form, it will soon become part of core Docutils.  There is
  some related code in David Goodger's sandbox (pysource_reader_) and
  a `Python Source Reader`_ document.

  .. Is this usable for end users?  Maybe move to a "Developers"
     section?

* The Docutils interface to PythonPoint_, also by Richard Jones,
  produces PDF presentations using ReportLabs.

* Engelbert Gruber has begun a `ManPage Writer`_.

* Oliver Rutherfurd has begun a `DocBook Writer`_ component and
  `HT2HTML integration`_ component.

* Gunnar Schwant's DocFactory_ is a wxPython GUI application for
  Docutils.

* Patrick O'Brien has taken over the `OpenOffice.org Writer`_.

* For Wikis, please see the `FAQ entry about Wikis`_.

* Bill Bumgarner has written a `simple HTML writer`_ that doesn't rely
  on CSS (stylesheets).

* Beni Cherniavsky has written a generic `preprocessing module`_ for
  roles and/or directives and built preprocessors for TeX math for
  both LaTeX and HTML output on top of it.

* Beni Cherniavsky maintains a Makefile_ for driving Docutils, hoping
  to handle everything one might do with docutils.
