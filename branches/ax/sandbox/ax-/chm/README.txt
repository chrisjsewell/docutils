Subject: docutils (rst) User Documentation in Microsoft HTML Help (chm) format
Date: Dienstag, 1. Juli 2003 16:35

hi all,

i just converted a big part of the docutils (rst) User Documentation
(Intro, Primer, Quick rst, spec, FAQ, ...) into chm format. this is
quite handy (for people who can use chm ;)) - it's all in one place,
with a single toc, and fully searchable.

this sandbox contains the chm plus the HTML Help project (.hhp) and toc 
(.hhc) files.

for future versions, i'll try one of the rst-to-docbook converters and
the docbook chm writer to automatically generate a complete
documentation. current version doesn't include all documentation and
doesn't link all toc entries to their subheadings properly.
