========
Overview
========

This directory contains a number of modules that add functionality to
docutils.

1. The package docutils_nest adds functionality to docutils. XML authors
    and developers might find it useful. Others will not find it useful.

   As its name implies, docutils_nest allows users to add nested inline
   structure to a rst document.

   See the README.txt in /docutils_nest.

2. rst_to_docbook

  This script has not been written. It will convert rst to docbook,
  using xml tools such as xslt.


just a test.
