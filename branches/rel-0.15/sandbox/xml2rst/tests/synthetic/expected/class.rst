.. class:: c18

- A bullet list

  .. class:: c19

  + Nested bullet list.

  .. class:: c20

  + Nested item 2.

Enumerated Lists
----------------

.. class:: c21

1. Arabic numerals.

   .. class:: c22

   a) lower alpha)

    .. class:: c26

    The field marker is a colon, the field name, and a colon.

    .. class:: c27

    The field body may contain one or more body elements, indented
    relative to the field marker.

Option Lists
------------

For listing command-line options:

.. class:: c28

-a
    command-line option "a"


.. class:: c29

-x, -y, -z
    Multiple options are an "option group".


Literal Blocks
--------------

Literal blocks are indicated with a double-colon ("::") at the end of
the preceding paragraph (over there ``-->``). They can be indented

.. class:: c30

::

    if literal_block:
        text = 'is left as-is'
        spaces_and_linebreaks = 'are preserved'
        markup_processing = None

Or they can be quoted without indentation

.. class:: c31

::

>> Great idea!
>
> Why didn't I think of that?

Line Blocks
-----------

This section tests line blocks. Line blocks are body elements which
consist of lines and other line blocks. Nested line blocks cause
indentation.

.. class:: c32

| This is a line block. It ends with a blank line.

.. class:: c33

| New lines begin with a vertical bar ("|").

Block Quotes
------------

Block quotes consist of indented body elements:

    .. class:: c34

    My theory by A. Elk. Brackets Miss, brackets. This theory goes as
    follows and begins now. All brontosauruses are thin at one end, much
    much thicker in the middle and then thin again at the far end. That
    is my theory, it is mine, and belongs to me and I own it, and what
    it is too.
