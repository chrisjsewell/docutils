I have the latest from PyPI and current docutils.
Here is a test document:
https://subversion.american.edu/aisaac/misc/slides_test01.rst

Below is the broken handling of the title, subtitle, author, and date.

Cheers,

PS Would you and Paul-Michael please consider maintaining this in
the sandbox?  With so few contributors, surely SVN should not be a burden?
If it had been in the sandbox, I would have 1) found it more easily, and
2)  just fixed this problem...



Basic use:
\title{%
  \phantomsection%
  \label{test-1-for-slides-writers}}
\author{}
\date{}
\maketitle
Test 1 for Slides WritersSubtitle\textbf{Author}: &
       Au Thor \\
\textbf{Date}: &
       January 1, 2525 \\
\item[{institution:}]
Cu U


With --use-latex-docinfo:

\title{%
  \phantomsection%
  \label{test-1-for-slides-writers}}
\author{Au Thor}
\date{January 1, 2525}

Feature requests for Ryan and Paul-Michael:
0. Fix docinfo handling (see above)
1. rst2latex provides translation of unicode characters;
   can you make direct use of this?  It is very
   convenient.
2. add a math directive.  Ideal would be to
   use Jen's work in rst2latexmath, but just wrapping
   the content in an equation environment would do for now.
3. handle literal text like rst2latex does.  The
   currently handling is a problem (e.g., leading
   spaces disappear)
4. don't add the ``fragile`` option to every frame.
   Ideally you would test problematic content,
   but until then handle this by having the author
   tag the content as fragile with a ``class`` directive.

5. don't make lists incremental by default;
   in many presentation setting such incrementalism
   is imo needless controlling (and thus "evil").
   Rely on users to set an ``incremental`` class
   when this is really needed.
