\poemtitle{Eric the Half-a-Bee}
\begin{verse}
A one, two, a one two three four \\!

Half a bee, philosophically, \\
\vin must, \emph{ipso facto}, half not be. \\
But half the bee has got to be, \\
\vin \emph{vis a vis} its entity.  D'you see? \\!

But can a bee be said to be \\
\vin or not to be an entire bee, \\
\vin when half the bee is not a bee, \\
\vin due to some ancient injury? \\!

Singing... \\
