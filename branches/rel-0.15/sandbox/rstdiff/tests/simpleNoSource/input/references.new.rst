Header
======

Text containing no *header* reference. Some more text for an
`internal target`_.

For http://example.net/ there can be links__ in the text or
email@example.net addresses. An _`internal target` needs to be
referenced, too. A footnote [#footnote]_ is missing. But
that's it. Wait, anonymous_ targets are still missing as well as
|sub| references.

__ http://links.net/

.. [#footnote] Changed footnote text.

.. _anonymous: http://anonymous.org/

.. |sub| replace:: replaced
