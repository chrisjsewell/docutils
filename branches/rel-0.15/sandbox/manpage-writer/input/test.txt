Line blocks
-----------

| This is a line block.  It ends with a blank line.
|     Each new line begins with a vertical bar ("|").
|     Line breaks and initial indents are preserved.
| Continuation lines are wrapped portions of long lines;
  they begin with a space in place of the vertical bar.
|     The left edge of a continuation line need not be aligned with
  the left edge of the text above it.

| This is a second line block.
|
| Blank lines are permitted internally, but they must begin with a "|".

    |
    | But can a bee be said to be
    |     or not to be an entire bee,
    |         when half the bee is not a bee,

BUGS
====

Numerous mapping problems.

1. Where do we get the manual section number from ? Commandline ?
2. docutils authors should be filled into section "AUTHORS".
3. be carefull with linebreaks in generated code.
4. list items. 
   bullets and enumerators.
