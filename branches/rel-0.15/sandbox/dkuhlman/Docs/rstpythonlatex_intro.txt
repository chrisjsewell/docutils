:abstract: This document describes a Docutils writer for use with
    Python LaTeX and the Python project's documentation tools.


==============================================
Introduction to the Documenting Python Writer
==============================================


-------------
What It Does
-------------

This writer for Docutils generates LaTeX suitable for
input to the documentation system described in `Documenting
Python`_

.. _`Documenting Python`: http://www.python.org/dev/doc/devel/doc/doc.html


---------------
Where to Get It
---------------

This writer is not yet part of the Docutils distribution.  Until
it is, you can find it at
`"A Docutils writer for the Documenting Python system"`_.

.. _`"A Docutils writer for the Documenting Python system"`:
    http://www.rexx.com/~dkuhlman/#docutils_pythonlatex


--------------
How to Use It
--------------

Conversion has several steps:

1.  Run the writer -- Run *documenting_python.py* in
    *docutils/tools*, for example::

       $ docutils/tools/python_latex.py --documentclass=howto rstpythonlatex_intro.txt

    There is one option:


    --documentclass=class 

        Selects the template type from Doc/templates in the Python
        source distribution. Possible values are ``howto``,
        ``manual``, and ``module``. The ``module`` document type is
        not yet implemented. See the Doc/templates subdirectory in the
        Python Source code distribution for samples of these document
        types.  

    .. ("module" too, according to the writer's settings_spec.  Or should
       "module" be removed from the writer?)

2.  Run the "Documenting Python" document processor.


Here is a Makefile that performs these two steps.  It was used to
convert the document that you are currently reading::

    # Makefile to process a file LaTeX with the Python LaTeX system.
    #  Optionally processes reStructuredText files.

    #
    # Change the following to point to your Python source code.
    #
    PYTHON_SRC = /w1/Python/Python-2.3b2
    DOCUTILS_DIR = /w1/Python/DocUtils/docutils

    #
    # Change the following to point to your Docutils installation.
    #
    DOCUTILSTOOLS_DIR = $(DOCUTILS_DIR)/tools
    TRANSFORMDOCPY = $(DOCUTILSTOOLS_DIR)/python_latex.py \
    	--documentclass=howto

    #
    # Change these flags for your purposes.
    #
    #HTMLFLAGS= --image-type png --html -s 1 --favicon ../icons/pyfav.gif
    HTMLFLAGS= --iconserver ../icons --html -s 1 --favicon ../icons/pyfav.gif

    MKHOWTO = $(PYTHON_SRC)/Doc/tools/mkhowto

    PAPER = a4

    #
    # Change this to the name of your source file (without extension).
    #
    #SRC_NAME=zip-ls
    ifndef SRC_NAME
    $(error Must define SRC_NAME (no extension), e.g. make SRC_NAME=mysourcefile)
    endif

    TARGETS = $(SRC_NAME)/$(SRC_NAME).html

    FIGURES = 

    all:	html

    html:	$(TARGETS) $(FIGURES)

    $(SRC_NAME)/$(SRC_NAME).html: $(SRC_NAME).tex
    	$(MKHOWTO) $(HTMLFLAGS) $(SRC_NAME).tex

    #
    # Remove or Comment out the following lines if your source file
    #   is a LaTeX file not a reST file.
    #
    $(SRC_NAME).tex: $(SRC_NAME).txt
    	$(TRANSFORMDOCPY) $(SRC_NAME).txt > $(SRC_NAME).tex

    clean:
    	rm -f *~ *.aux *.idx *.ilg *.ind *.log *.toc *.bkm *.syn \
    *.pla *.eps *.pdf *.ps *.lof *.l2h *.tex2 *.dvi
    	-rm -f $(SRC_NAME).tex
    	-rm -f $(SRC_NAME)/*
    	-rmdir $(SRC_NAME)
    	-rm -f $(SRC_NAME).tex


Run this Makefile with the following commands::

    $ make SRC_NAME=rstpythonlatex_intro clean
    $ make SRC_NAME=rstpythonlatex_intro
  



------------------------------
Special Formatting Constructs
------------------------------

See the companion document 'Quick reStructuredText for
"Documenting Python"' for additional mark-up that can be used when
generating LaTeX for "Documenting Python".  It is included in the
distribution file for this writer.

The first section of that document has information specific to the
generation of LaTeX for Documenting Python.

In addition, that document also adds another column to the
specification tables.  This additional column describes the LaTeX
commands generated by this writer.


-----------------
Acknowledgements
-----------------

Thanks to the Docutils project members for Docutils.  In
particular, thanks to project coordinator David Goodger.

Thanks to Engelbert Gruber for the implementation of the LaTeX
writer.  That implementation formed the starting point for this
writer.  He should get much of the credit for this writer also,
however, any bugs were likely introduced by me.

Thanks to Fred Drake (and many more I'm sure) for the Python
documentation tools, the Python documentation project, and the
Python documentation itself.
