   Hey!

   A one, two, a one two three four

   Half a bee, philosophically,
       must, *ipso facto*, half not be.
   But half the bee has got to be,
       *vis a vis* its entity.  D'you see?

   But can a bee be said to be
       or not to be an entire bee,
           when half the bee is not a bee,
               due to some ancient injury?
