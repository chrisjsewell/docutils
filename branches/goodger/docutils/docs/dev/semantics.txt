These are notes for a possible future PEP providing the final piece of
the Python docstring puzzle.

PythonDoc
=========

A Python version of the JavaDoc semantics (not syntax).  A set of
conventions which are understood by the Docutils.

- Can we extract comments from parsed modules?  Could be handy for
  documenting function/method parameters::

      def method(self,
                 source,        # path of input file
                 dest           # path of output file
                ):

  This would save having to repeat parameter names in the docstring.

  Idea from Mark Hammond's 1998-06-23 Doc-SIG post, "Re: [Doc-SIG]
  Documentation tool":

      it would be quite hard to add a new param to this method without
      realising you should document it

- Use field lists or definition lists for "tagged blocks".
