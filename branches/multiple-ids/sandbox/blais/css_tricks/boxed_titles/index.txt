Box Title
=========

.. .. raw:: html
.. 
..    <img src="castro.png" alt="My Face" class="home-image1" />
..    <h1 class="box-title">Viva Los Boxed Titles!</h1>

This is a trick that shows how to do a kind of slightly fancier heading with an
image by using a tiny bit of raw HTML and CSS.  There would be a way to minimize
the few raw HTML directives that this requires:

From <http://docutils.sf.net/spec/notes.html#directives>:

Add a "class" option to many/most directives, to set an arbitrary "class"
attribute on the enclosing element?  Perhaps "name" as well?

It may be useful to add an option [*] to the HTML writer to restrict the
document title to <head><title> only, and not include it in the document body.
As for the "raw" stuff, a combination of the "image" directive's "align" option,
the yet-to-be-implemented "class" directive, and stylesheet magic may allow such
effects without resorting to raw HTML.

We continue with a similar trick for the bottom part.

.. raw:: html

  <img SRC="clinton.png" class="home-image2" />
  <h2 class="box-title">I love boxed titles too!</h2>

Oh yeah!
