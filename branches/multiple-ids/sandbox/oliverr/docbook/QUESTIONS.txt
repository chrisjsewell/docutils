Docutils DocBook Writer Questions
=================================

Open Issues
===========

* Docutils ``transition`` elements don't seem to have any equivlent in 
  DocBook.  How should these be handled?

* Currently, Docutil ``topic`` elements with no classes are treated get 
  mapped to ``section`` elements.  Should this be handled differently?

* How should Docutils System Messages be handled?  Could generate an 
  appendix or section at the end of the document which contained all 
  system messages handled as ``note`` elements.

* How should ``problematic`` elements be handled?  One idea is to 
  generate a ``remark`` element with a reference to an error message 
  somewhere else in the document.

* Bibliographic/DocInfo elements are the biggest pain the arse!  In 
  order to get a release out, why not just try to display them, instead 
  of mapping them to DocBook elements?  A mixed approach could be to 
  write a separate visitor for DocInfo elements which could collect the 
  data, then the primary writer could use ``author``, ``copyright``, 
  etc... for inclusion in the info section of the generated document, 
  and the rest could be displayed.

* DocBook XSL Stylesheets don't seem to respect the ``label`` attribute 
  for footnotes.  Is this a bug with the stylesheets or is it not used?

  Current feelings: that's a DocBook XSL Stylesheet problem.  However, 
  I should look into it.

* Can author element be inserted regardless of whether there is text?
