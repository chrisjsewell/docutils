Targets
-------

.. _example:

This paragraph is pointed to by the explicit "example" target. A
reference can be found under `Inline Markup`_, above. `Inline
hyperlink targets`_ are also possible.

Section headers are implicit targets, referred to by name. See
Targets_, which is a subsection of `Body Elements`_.

Explicit external targets are interpolated into references such as
"Python_".

.. _Python: http://www.python.org/

Targets may be indirect and anonymous.  Thus `this phrase`__ may also
refer to the Targets_ section.

__ Targets_

Here's a `hyperlink reference without a target`_, which generates an
error.

Duplicate Target Names

Duplicate names in section headers or other implicit targets will
generate "info" (level-1) system messages.  Duplicate names in
explicit targets will generate "warning" (level-2) system messages.

Duplicate Target Names

Since there are two "Duplicate Target Names" section headers, we
cannot uniquely refer to either of them by name.  If we try to (like
this: `Duplicate Target Names`_), an error is generated.
