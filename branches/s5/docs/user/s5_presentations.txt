.. class:: handout

   This document serves as both manual and example of the s5.py writer
   and rst2s5.py front end.

An introduction to generating S5 slide shows with Docutils and
reStructuredText.

*(Hit the space bar or click the mouse button to proceed.)*

.. container:: handout

   The first slide consists of all visible text between the document
   title and the first section title.  The document title is also
   added to the footer of all slides.

   The "footer" directive is used to specify part of the slide footer
   text.  It is currently limited to one short line (one paragraph).

.. footer:: Location |bullet| Date


Introduction
============

``rst2s5.py`` is a Docutils_ front end that outputs HTML for use with
S5_, a "Simple Standards-based Slide Show System" by Eric Meyer.

* A simple reStructuredText-format text file serves as input.

* Presentations can be viewed using any modern web browser that
  supports CSS, JavaScript, and XHTML.  (It even works with IE!)

* Several themes are available, and they're easy to adapt.

  .. container:: handout

     Some sites with S5 slide shows or themes:

     * http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/themes/
     * http://mozilla.wikicities.com/wiki/Firefox_S5:Designs

     And a short tutorial on how to create themes:
     http://yatil.de/s5/dokumentation/9/ (german text)

* The slides and extra handout material can be combined in one
  document.  The handout can be printed directly from the browser, and
  it will contain more than just silly framed slides.

Basic Usage
===========

Based on Docutils, normal reStructuredText documents are supported.
Each first-level section is converted to a single slide.

.. topic:: Installation
   :class: handout

   Prerequisites: Python and the docutils package have to be
   installed.

   Install ``s5.py`` in docutils/writers, ``rst2s5.py`` to a directory
   in the ``$PATH``.  (Or copy both files to the same folder,
   e.g. ``/usr/local/bin`` on un*x).

An S5 slide show HTML file is generated with the following command::

    rst2s5.py presentation.txt presentation.html

Open ``presentation.html`` in any modern graphical browser.

Click the "|mode|" button to switch between presentation & handout
modes.  In presentation mode, mouse over to the lower right-hand
corner to display the controls.

.. topic:: UI Details
   :class: handout

   Details of the S5 user interface can be found at `Eric Meyer's S5
   page`__.

.. |mode| unicode:: U+00D8 .. capital o with stroke
__ S5_


Features
========

The S5 Writer supports all the standard Docutils HTML features.
S5-specific features:

.. class:: incremental

* The document title is duplicated on each slide in the S5 footer.

* The ``footer`` directive may be used to define additional text in
  the S5 footer, but it is limited to one line of text.

  .. container:: handout

     This is useful for information such as the date of the
     presentation and/or the location.  The field in the footer is
     left blank if no ``footer`` directive is used.

     Example::

         .. footer:: Location - Date

* The contents of any element with a "class" attribute value of
  "handout" are only visible when the presentation is printed.
  "Handout"-class contents are hidden in the screen presentation.

  .. container:: handout

     Handout contents are also visible on the screen if the S5 "raw
     view mode" is active.

     The text in "handout"-class elements are hidden in the slide show
     on the screen.  This can be used to provide more detailed
     information in a handout.

     "Handout"-class elements can appear anywhere in the text, as
     often as needed.

     Arbitrary handout blocks can be created using the ``container``
     directive::

         .. container:: handout

            Put anything you like here...

* An "incremental" class can be assigned to lists and other elements
  to get one-item-at-a-time behavior (like this list).


Feature Examples
================

.. sidebar:: Images too!

    .. image:: happy_monkey.png
       :alt: sample image

=====  =====  ======
  A      B    A or B
=====  =====  ======
False  False  False
True   False  True
False  True   True
True   True   True
=====  =====  ======

.. Hint:: Admonitions, tables, sidebars, and other elements can be
   used in on-screen presentations in handouts.

.. topic:: Handout only
   :class: handout

   Elements only visible in the handout can also be generated using a
   ``:class: handout`` option with ``sidebar``, ``compound`` and other
   directives.

.. class:: handout

The ``.. class:: handout`` directive can be used to tag single
paragraphs and other elements.


Incremental Examples (1)
========================

*(Press the space bar to proceed.)*

.. class:: incremental

   Paragraphs can be displayed one at a time...

   .. container::

      ... or a bunch at a time.

      This second paragraph is displayed together with the previous
      one by grouping them with the "container" directive.

.. role:: incremental
.. default-role:: incremental

| `We can also display` `one` `word` `at` `a` `time,`
| `or a phrase` `at a time,`
| `or even` `o`\ `n`\ `e` `l`\ `e`\ `t`\ `t`\ `e`\ `r` `at a time!`
|
| `(But it ain't pretty.)`


Incremental Examples (2)
========================

(TODO: insert an example of animation here)


Themes
======

The presentation theme consists of several additional files:
stylesheets, JavaScript, and graphics.  These go into a subdirectory
of the ``ui`` directory beside ``presentation.html``.

.. container:: handout

   The themes from the S5 tutorial can be used.  Get it here:
   http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/s5blank.zip.

   These themes are in the public domain and may be redistributed
   freely.

The S5 theme (``ui/`` subdirectory name) can be specified with the
``--theme`` command-line option or the ``theme`` configuration file
setting.

.. container:: handout

   Example::

       rst2s5 --theme pixel presentation.txt presentation.html

   The default theme is "default".

   Usualy, themes are placed in a folder with the specified name,
   inside a ``ui`` folder inside the folder containing the
   presentation.  But it is also possible to use URLs and grab the
   design from another website.


Example Themes
==============

(TODO: insert some screenshots here)

* default (simplified version of S5's default theme)
* inverse (white text on a black background)
* big (very large text, no footers)
* big_inverse


Caveats
=======

1. The ``contents`` (table of contents) directive must not be used.
   It changes the CSS class of headings and they won't show up
   correctly in the screen presentation.

   .. TODO: Add a "disable table of contents" setting to the parser?
      The S5 writer could set it as a default.


2. Subsections ...
------------------

... may be used, but you may have to provide your own stylesheet
support.  Subsections work just fine in handouts though.


Generating a Slide Show (1)
===========================

.. class:: incremental

1. Open a console (terminal, command shell) and go to the folder
   containing your file, say ``presentation.txt``.

2. Run the command::

       rst2s5.py presentation.txt presentation.html

3. Normally the Docutils default stylesheet, ``html4css1.css``, will
   be embedded in the output HTML.  If you choose to link to a
   stylesheet instead of embedding, you must include a copy.


Generating a Slide Show (2)
===========================

.. class:: incremental

4. In the same folder as ``presentation.txt``, extract the sample
   theme from http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/s5blank.zip (this
   should create a ``ui`` folder).

5. Open ``presentation.html`` in a web browser.

6. Make the browser window full-screen and speak.

7. Profit!
