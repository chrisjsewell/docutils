====

The Wiki module primarily exports the `WikiPage` class:

    class `WikiPage(object)`:
        WikiPage is a class to represent one page in a WikiWikiWeb [#]_.
        The page may or may not yet exist -- that is, it may not yet
        have content.
        
        .. [#] http://c2.com/cgi-bin/wiki
        
        It has the following properties and methods:
        
            `html`:
                A read-only property giving the HTML for the page.
                If the page does not yet have content the text
                ``"This page has not yet been created"`` is returned.
            `text`:
                The text for the page.  To save new text, simply
                assign to this property.
            `title`:
                The title of the page.
            `name`:
                The name of the page -- a canonical identifier.
                Related to the title, but not necessarily the
                same.
            `exists()`:
                Does this page have content yet?
            `modifiedDate()`:
                Date modified (integer timestamp)
            `modifiedDateText()`:
                Text representation of modified date
            `preview(text)`:
                Returns an HTML preview of the text

There are also several searching methods:

    `allPages()`:
        All pages with content in the system
    `recentPages()`:
        All pages, sorted by date modified, most recent first
    `search(text)`:
        Search titles and bodies of pages for ``text``, returning list
        of pages
    `searchTitles(text)`:
        Search page titles for ``text``, returning list of pages

There is one module global to be printed at the top of
every Wiki page:

    `css`:
        The HTML to put the proper CSS at the top of the page.  This
        should be put in the ``<head>`` section of the page.
