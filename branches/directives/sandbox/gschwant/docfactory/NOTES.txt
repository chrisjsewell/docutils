To Do
=====

* Convert system message handling from stderr parsing to simply using
  the "line" attribute of system_message elements, accessible from
  ``document.parse_messages`` and ``document.transform_messages``.
  [David Goodger]

* Use the docutils.conf config file mechanism.  May require changes to
  the current Docutils setup.  [David Goodger]

* Add a dependency checking mechanism, like that in pep2html.py.
  [David Goodger]

* Any variable data saved between runs should be stored in the user's
  home directory; perhaps in a ~/.docutils file.  [David Goodger]


Ideas
=====

* Should the interface be file-centric instead of project-centric?  I
  think the user should be able to open a file, edit it, and process
  it, without having to create a project first.  Projects should be
  optional.  [David Goodger]

* What is the current representation of a project?  Is it best? 
  [David Goodger]
