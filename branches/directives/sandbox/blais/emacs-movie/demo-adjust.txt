:Abstract: 

   This is a short interactive demonstration to show-off some of
   the features of the emacs support in rst.el





















































[A] There is a single multi-purpose key binding for underlining
section titles. By default it is bound to C-=.  It can do all sorts
of things.

Apples, what else?






















































[B] By default, the newly suggested title is one "below" the last
    one in the hierarchy.

Oranges too





















































[C] Invoke it twice to go up the hierarchy.
    After it gets to the top, it cycles back down.

Bananas contain healthy sugar





















































[D] Use a negative argument to go in the other direction.

Lemon is tasty





















































[E] If a region is active, the promotion/demotion occurs for all
    the titles within the region.



















































Don't drop pommegranate in your washing machine

Fruta Bomba is also known as Mayabe

Jaune-citron is a colour name in french






















































Another useful binding exists on C-x C-= 

1. [F] Invoked, it displays a temporary buffer






















































2. [G] With a prefix arg (C-u C-x C-=), it displays the hierarchy
   of the title decorations.





















































[H] You can insert a table of contents with C-x +

    Here:  




















































[I] This is useful at the top of the document, in a comment. 
    [above]





















































[J] You can maintain this up-to-date automatically by binding a
    special function to rst-adjust-hook::

      (add-hook 'rst-adjust-hook 'rst-toc-insert-update)

    [eval, then above]




















































[K] You can also navigate between the section titles 
    with C-M-{ and C-M-}.
