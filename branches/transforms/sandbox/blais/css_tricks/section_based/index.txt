=========================
Section-Based CSS Changes
=========================

Introduction
------------

In this example, we just want to demonstrate simply that one can customize the
content style by using CSS with the automatically-generated title classes.

This is a bit of a hack but it can be useful under some circumstances.

Red Section
-----------

For example, this section contains red items.

* Yes, this should be read.
* No, you must be ``red``.


Green Section
-------------

* But here we turn green.


Blue Section
------------

* A problem with this approach is that if you change the section title the CSS
  file has to be changed as well.
