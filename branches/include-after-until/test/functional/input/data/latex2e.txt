Some Tests for the LaTeX2e Writer
=================================

These tests have been written to exercise some unusual combinations of
syntax elements which may cause trouble for the LaTeX writer but do
not need to be tested with other writers (e.g. the HTML writer).

This file is user by the standalone_rst_latex test.

Option lists
============

The LaTeX-2e description environment is used for definition lists. 
The definition is continued on the same line as the term, this should
not happen if a option-list is at the top of the definition.

If the option list is not at the first element in the definition, it
is contained in a quote

  --help  show help
  -v      verbose

In a definition list:
  --help  show help
  -v      verbose
