Hyperlinks and -targets
-----------------------

In LaTeX, we must set an explicit anchor (``\phantomsection``) for a 
_`hypertarget in plain text` but not in a table or figure caption:

.. table:: Table with _`hypertarget in table title`.

   =====  ===== =====
   False  True  None
   =====  ===== =====

.. figure:: ../../../docs/user/rst/images/biohazard.png

   Figure with _`hypertarget in figure caption`.
   
   Legend with _`hypertarget in figure legend`.
   
See `hypertarget in plain text`_,
`hypertarget in table title`_,
`hypertarget in figure caption`_, and
`hypertarget in figure legend`_,
