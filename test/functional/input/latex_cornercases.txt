Some Tests for the LaTeX Writer
===============================

These tests contain unusual combinations of syntax elements which may cause
trouble for the LaTeX writer but do not need to be tested with other writers.

Block Quotes
------------

    This block quote comes directly after the section heading and is
    followed by a paragraph.

    This is the second paragraph of the block quote and it contains
    some more text filling up some space which would otherwise be
    empty.

    -- Attribution

This is a paragraph.

    This block quote does not have an attribution.

This is another paragraph.

    Another block quote at the end of the section.

Rowspanning tables
------------------

Several rowspanning cells in a table.

Problem:

In LaTeX, "overwritten" cells need to be defined as empty cells.

Docutils (similarily to HTML) uses is the "Exchange Table Model" (also known
as CALS tables, see docs/ref/soextblx.dtd) which defines only the remaining
cells in a row "affected" by multirow cells.

Therefore, visit_entry() is only called for the remaining cells and the
LaTeX writer needs bookkeeping to write out the required number of extra
'&'s.
