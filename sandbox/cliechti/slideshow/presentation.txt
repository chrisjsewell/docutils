S5 Slideshows using reST
========================

.. The main title above is used as slideshow title, but each slide has to
   start with a subtitle, including the very first slide. The title of
   the first slide will be the same as the main title above in most cases.
   
   There must not be any visible text between the main title and the first
   subtitle. It would be visible on all slides.

.. See below for an explanation for the following substitution
.. |s5 location| replace::
        The contents of the ``|s5 location|`` substitution is shown here.

Short introduction to the S5 converter for Docutils

Introduction
------------
``rst2s5`` is a Docutils__ writer for S5__, a Simple Standards-based Slide
Show System.

*   A simple text file with ``reST`` compatible text, serves as input.

*   Presentations can be viewed using any modern webbrowser
    (CSS, JavaScript, XHTML).

*   Several themes are available on the Internet, easy to adapt.

*   Slides and handout can be combined in one document.

Usage
-----
Based on Docutils, normal ``reST`` documents are supported. Each section is
converted to a single slide.

.. handout::
    
    *Installation*
    
    Install ``s5.py`` in docutils/writers, ``rst2s5`` to a directory in the
    ``$PATH``. (Or copy both files to the same folder. e.g. ``/usr/local/bin``
    on un*x)

A slideshow is simply made by the following command::

    rst2s5 presentation.txt presentation.html

Some additional files are needed to view a presentation. These
go into the same directory as the ``presentation.html``

*   The standard ``default.css``. This is not needed when the
    ``--embed-stylesheet`` option is used  when converting the slideshow.
    
    .. handout::
        The ``default.css`` is included in the standard docutils distribution.
        One can also be downloaded from here:
        http://docutils.sf.net/tools/stylesheets/default.css

*   A subdirectory with the S5 theme. The default slideshow parameters
    use the ``ui`` theme.
    
    .. handout::
        The default theme from the S5 tutorial can be used. Get it here:
        http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/s5blank.zip
        
        Most of these themes are available under the `Creative Commons Share
        Alike`__ license. This means the themes can be used for commercial and
        non-commercial purposes. But the rst2s5 converter has a different
        license. Therefore no theme is distributed along with the converter.

.. class:: handout
.. hint::
    Basic steps to create a slideshow:
    
    1. run ``rst2s5 presentation.txt presentation.html``
    2. copy a ``default.css`` from docutils to the same directory
    3. extract the sample theme from ``s5blank.zip``, mentioned above,
       to the same directory (this should create a ``ui`` folder).
    4. open ``presentation.html`` in your webbrowser.


Features
--------
``rst2s5`` is based on ``rst2html``, it basicaly supports all of its features.

Additions:

*   ``.. handout::`` directive: These blocks are only visible when the
    presentation is printed and in raw view mode. They are hidden in the
    screen presentation.
  
    .. handout::
        Text in ``.. handout::`` block is only visible in the printed material
        and not in the slideshow on the screen. This can be used to be more
        detailed in a handout.
        
        ``.. handout::`` directives can appear anywhere in the Text, as
        often as needed.

*   The ``|s5 theme|`` substitution can define a different S5 theme.

    .. handout::
        The substitution changes the default theme that is used. 
        For example, use the "pixel" theme::
        
        .. |s5 theme| replace:: pixel
        
        The default theme is "ui". The command line switch ``--theme``,
        described below, overrides the default as well as the ``|s5 theme|``
        substitution.

*   The ``--theme`` command line option is used to specify a different directory
    with the S5 stylesheets/design files.

    .. handout::
        Example::
        
            rst2s5 --theme pixel presentation.txt presentation.html

*   The ``|s5 location|`` substitution defines additional text in the S5 footer.

    .. handout::
        The extra information in the slideshows footer can be set by this
        substitution. It makes sense to use a ``replace`` directive to
        assign some text like the date of the presentation and/or the
        location.
        
        The field in the footer is left blank if the substitution is missing.
        
        Example::
        
            .. |s5 location| replace:: Location/Date of presentation


Samples: Tables, Directives, Images
-----------------------------------

.. sidebar:: Images are OK

    .. image:: ui/bodybg.gif
        :scale: 30
        :alt: sample image

=====  =====  ======
   Inputs     Output
------------  ------
  A      B    A or B
=====  =====  ======
False  False  False
True   False  True
False  True   True
True   True   True
=====  =====  ======

.. hint::
    Admonitions, tables, sidebars can all be used on the screen and in
    the handout.
    
.. sidebar::     Handout only
    :class: handout

    Elements only visible in the handout can also be generated using the
    :class: attribute on sidebars, compounds and other elements.

.. compound:: :class: handout
    
    An other text, only on the handout.


Caveats
-------
*   The ``.. contents::`` directive must not be used. It changes the CSS class
    of headings and they won't show up correctly in the screen presentation.

*   ``.. handout::`` directives generate an error if other ``rst2XXX``
    convertors are used, instead of the S5 converter.
