Listing pros and cons
*********************

What is the most elegant way to compile a list of (dis-) advantages with
rst?

itemize:
  + concise
  + clear source
  
  - shows only dots in output

classy itemize:
  .. class:: advantages
  
  + clear source
  + output can by styled with css
  
  .. class: disadvantages
  
  - no longer concise
  - does not (currently) work with LaTeX export
 

option list:
  +1  concise
  +1  clear source
  -2  does not work reliably (needs number)
  -1  less straightforward
  -2  "abusing" special list type
    
line block:
  | + works reliably, correct output
  | - list items not aligned (+ wider than -)
  | - rating "hidden" in source
  | - no semantic markup (generic block for special list type)

line block with U+2212 "minus sign":
  | + works reliably, correct output
  | + list items aligned
  | − rating "hidden" in source
  | − minus sign not easily input with most text editors
  | − minus sign not distinguishable from '-' (HYPHEN-MINUS) in fixed
      with fonts

field list:
  :+: aligned markers and items
  :-: "ugly" source
  :-: colon in output
