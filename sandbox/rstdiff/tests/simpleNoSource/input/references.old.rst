Header
======

Text containing a header_ reference. Some more text for an
_`internal target`.

For http://example.org/ there can be links_ in the text or
email@example.org addresses. An `internal target`_ needs to be
referenced, too. A footnote [#footnote]_ is missing. But
that's it. Wait, anonymous__ targets are still missing as well as
|sub| references.

.. _links: http://links.org/

.. [#footnote] Footnote text.

__ http://anonymous.org/

.. |sub| replace:: substitution
