Docutils Mailing List FAQ
=========================

The proposed sandbox expands the FAQ docutils to:

* Expand into three topics in greater depth:

  * reST
  * docutils
  * docutils development

* breaks the FAQ.txt in the root of the docutils project into ./docs.
* Cover additinal questions by looking back on questions since the
  inception of the docutils list, as well as other third party sources
  where docutils is covered.
