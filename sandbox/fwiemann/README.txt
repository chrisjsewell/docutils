This is my sandbox.  Here I store anything that does not belong into
the Docutils main tree.

Please do not feel excluded; you are welcome to change things as you
see fit.

Overview:

:`<commit-email>`_: A patch to commit-email.pl used for the Docutils
    check-in mailing list.

:`<dbackport.sh>`_: Back-port changes from the trunk to the
    maintenance branch.

:`<fsfsbackup.sh>`_: Backup (mirror) an FSFS repository via SSH.  Used
    to backup the Docutils Subversion repository.

:`<release.sh>`_: The script I'm using to make releases of Docutils.

:`<uploaddocutils.sh>`_: Upload files to http://docutils.sf.net/tmp/
    using ``scp``, inserting the current date in the file name.

:`<xhtml2rest>`_: An XHTML to reST conversion script by Antonios
    Christofides I once received via the mailing list.
