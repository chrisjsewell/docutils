Simple and complex lists
------------------------

The `html4css1.HTMLTranslator` docstring says:

    This HTML writer has been optimized to produce visually compact
    lists (less vertical whitespace).  HTML's mixed content models
    allow list items to contain "<li><p>body elements</p></li>" or
    "<li>just text</li>" or even "<li>text<p>and body
    elements</p>combined</li>", each with different effects.  It would
    be best to stick with strict body elements in list items, but they
    affect vertical spacing in browsers (although they really
    shouldn't).

    Here is an outline of the optimization:

    - Check for and omit <p> tags in "simple" lists: list items
      contain either a single paragraph, a nested simple list, or a
      paragraph followed by a nested simple list.  This means that
      this list can be compact:

          - Item 1.
          - Item 2.

      But this list cannot be compact:

          - Item 1.

            This second paragraph forces space between list items.

          - Item 2.

    - In non-list contexts, omit <p> tags on a paragraph if that
      paragraph is the only child of its parent (footnotes & citations
      are allowed a label first).

    - Regardless of the above, in definitions, table cells, field bodies,
      option descriptions, and list items, mark the first child with
      'class="first"' and the last child with 'class="last"'.  The stylesheet
      sets the margins (top & bottom respectively) to 0 for these elements.

    The ``no_compact_lists`` setting (``--no-compact-lists`` command-line
    option) disables list whitespace optimization.

In `html4_strict`, the algorithm to determine if a list is "simple"
enough to be compacted includes field lists (in addition to ordered
lists and unordered lists).

   <style type="text/css"><!--
   dl.field-list > dd { margin-left:  40px;
                        padding-left: 0;
                        /* background: yellow; */
                      }
   --></style>
