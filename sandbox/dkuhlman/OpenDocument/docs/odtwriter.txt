Introduction
============

What it does -- ``rst2odt.py/odtwriter.py`` translate reST
(reStructuredText) into a Open Document Format ``.odt`` file.  You
can learn more about here:

- `OASIS Open Document Format for Office Applications
  (OpenDocument) TC`_

- `Open Document at Wikipedia`_


How to Use It
=============

Run it from the command line as follows::

    rst2odt.py myinput.txt myoutput.odt

Styles
======

``odtwriter`` uses a number of styles that defined in the default
``styles.xml``.  This section describes those styles.

You can modify the look of documents generated by ``odtwriter`` in
several ways:

- Edit ``styles.xml`` with a text editor.  **Hint:** If you intend
  to extract ``styles.xml`` from an ``.odt`` (and then "re-zip"
  it), you should turn off XML optimization/compression.  In
  ``oowriter``, use Tools --> Options... --> Load-Save --> General
  and turn off "Size optimization for XML format".
  
- Open a document generated by ``odtwriter`` in `oowriter``.  Now,
  edit the style you are interested in modifying.  To do so either
  (1) press F11 or (2) use menu item "Format/Styles and
  Formatting", then right-click on the relevant style and select
  "Modify".  Modify the style, then save your document.  Now, you
  can extract the styles.xml file from your document and either
  (1) use this as your default styles file or (2) copy and paste
  the relevant style definition into your styles.xml.

- Open an empty (or new) document in ``oowriter``.  Define the
  styles described in this section.  Then, use that document (a
  .odt file) as your stylesheet.  ``odtwriter`` will extract the
  ``styles.xml`` file from that document and insert it into the
  output document.

- Some combination of the above.

described here.
