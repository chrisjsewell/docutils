:Abstract:

    A simple front-end tool that takes care of invoking LaTeX in the same
    directory as the input rest file and that cleans up the remaining files
    doing its deed, and copies the PDF file in its final place.  This is a more
    convenient way to run rst2latex and produce the PDF file.
