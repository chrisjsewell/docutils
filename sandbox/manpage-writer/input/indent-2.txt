Example nesting in admonitions
==============================

Example
-------

In the manpage writer admonitions use troff's ``.IP``/``.RE`` for paragraph
indentation. This unfortunately does not appear to preserve indentation for
bullets and other block types (literal) that might be contained within an
admonition.

.. NOTE::
   This is an important note.

   * Bullet

   Example::

     $ man ls
