This is xhtml2rest.

It's a stop-gap solution for converting XHTML documents to
reStructuredText.

Please find the documentation inline at the beginning of the source
file.

The author is Antonios Christofides.  It's in my (Felix Wiemann's)
sandbox because he asked me to take care of it.  So please direct any
patches to Felix.Wiemann@ososo.de.

Have fun!
