Test-files for writers

``test_html4css1.txt`` and ``test_latex.txt`` are files which can be
used to test the writers.

Currently, there is no 'expected output', but I doubt it's necessary
at all.  Looking at how the resulting files are rendered should be
enough and takes much less time.

Note that in order to actually do the tests, this directory
(``testing/``) should be copied to the Docutils root, because there
are references to ``../docs/rst/images/``, which of course don't work
in the sandbox.

IMO these files should be moved to the main Docutils tree in the long
term, yet it hasn't been decided where exactly to store them.

Feel free to change anything you like.

Testing the HTML writer
-----------------------

Remember to include the stylesheet, or things might look
weird.

Testing the LaTeX writer
------------------------

In order to test the LaTeX writer, run::

    rst2latex.py test_latex.txt xxx.tex
    pdflatex xxx.tex
    acroread xxx.pdf
    rm xxx.*

Naming the resulting TeX-file ``xxx.tex`` makes deleting all those
files generated by LaTeX easier.  Note that you really need
``pdflatex``, because the standard ``latex`` won't eat non-EPS images.

Files in the ``data/`` directory
--------------------------------

The ``test_*.txt`` in the ``testing/`` directory include the files in
the ``data/`` directory, which contain the actual testing source.  I
decided not to split them more then necessary in order to make
maintenance easier.

If you want to test certain features while developing, you should
write your own test file or rip out the correspondent part from the
``data/*.txt`` files, so that you get a short, well-readable and
quickly-regeneratable document.
