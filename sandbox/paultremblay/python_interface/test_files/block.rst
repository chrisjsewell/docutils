In typesetting, block quotations can be distinguished from the
surrounding text by variation in typeface (often italic vs. roman),
type size, or by indentation. Often combinations of these methods are
used, but are not necessary. Block quotations are also visually
distinguished from preceding and following main text blocks by a white
line or half-line space.[3]

        critics, and have imagined them men of much greater profundity
        than they really are. From this complaisance the critics have
        been emboldened to assume a dictatorial power, and have so far
        succeeded that they are now become the masters, and have the
        assurance to give laws to those authors from whose
        predecessors they originally received them.
