Footnote testing
================


Paragraphs contain text and may contain inline markup: *emphasis*,
**strong emphasis**, 
footnote references (manually numbered [1]_, 
anonymous auto-numbered [#]_, labeled auto-numbered [#label]_, or 
symbolic [*]_), citation references ([CIT2002]_), and ... 

Footnotes
---------

.. [1] A footnote contains body elements, consistently indented by at
   least 3 spaces.

   This is the footnote's second paragraph.

.. [#label] Footnotes may be numbered, either manually (as in [1]_) or
   automatically using a "#"-prefixed label.  This footnote has a
   label so it can be referred to from multiple places, both as a
   footnore reference ([#label]_) and as a hyperlink reference
   (label_).

.. [#] This footnote is numbered automatically and anonymously using a
   label of "#" only.

.. [*] Footnotes may also use symbols, specified with a "*" label.
   Here's a reference to the next footnote: [*]_.

.. [*] This footnote shows the next symbol in the sequence.

.. [4] Here's a footnote, with a reference to a footnote: [5]_.



Citations
---------

.. [CIT2002] Citations are text-labeled footnotes. They may be
   rendered separately and differently from footnotes.

Here's a reference to the above, [CIT2002]_ citation.


.. [5] We need a lot to trigger the "too many floats".
