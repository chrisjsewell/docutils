Directives
----------

.. contents:: :local:

These are just a sample of the many reStructuredText Directives.  For
others, please see http://docutils.sf.net/spec/rst/directives.html.

Document Parts
``````````````

An example of the "contents" directive can be seen above this section
(a local, untitled table of contents_) and at the beginning of the
document (a document-wide `table of contents`_).

Images
``````

An image directive:

.. image:: images/title.png

A figure directive:

.. figure:: images/title.png
   :alt: reStructuredText, the markup syntax

   A figure is an image with a caption and/or a legend:

   +------------+-----------------------------------------------+
   | re         | Revised, revisited, based on 're' module.     |
   +------------+-----------------------------------------------+
   | Structured | Structure-enhanced text, structuredtext.      |
   +------------+-----------------------------------------------+
   | Text       | Well it is, isn't it?                         |
   +------------+-----------------------------------------------+

   This paragraph is also part of the legend.

Line Blocks
```````````

Take it away, Eric the Orchestra Leader!

.. line-block::

   A one, two, a one two three four

   Half a bee, philosophically,
       must, *ipso facto*, half not be.
   But half the bee has got to be,
       *vis a vis* its entity.  D'you see?

   But can a bee be said to be
       or not to be an entire bee,
           when half the bee is not a bee,
               due to some ancient injury?

   Singing...

.. |Python| replace:: Python, *the* best language around
