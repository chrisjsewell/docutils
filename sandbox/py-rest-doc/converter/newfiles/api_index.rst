:Release: |version|
:Date: |today|

This manual documents the API used by C and C++ programmers who want to write
extension modules or embed Python.  It is a companion to :ref:`extending-index`,
which describes the general principles of extension writing but does not
document the API functions in detail.

.. warning::

   The current version of this document is somewhat incomplete. However, most of
   the important functions, types and structures are described.
