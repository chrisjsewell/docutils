README for rst2graph
====================

Overview
========

**rst2graph** is a program to create a graph from the links contained
in a reStructuredText file. This is useful if you use linking in your
text and want to visualize the link structure in a graphical form.

**rst2graph** supports various output formats describing the resulting
graph in a certain formal syntax. So far Graphviz_ seems to be the
best tool to render the output to a graphical form.

**rst2graph** offers a number of options to select only certain
portions from the reStructuredText file. Using these options you can
create the subgraph you are interested in.

Installation
============

After you obtained and unpacked the package run something like ::

  python setup.py install

After installation you have the following commands to render graphs
from reStructuredText:

**rst2graph.py**
  The generic renderer. You must give an explicit output format to
  this command.

**rst2gv.py**, **rst2dot.py**
  Two commands rendering to dot_ format.

**rst2gxl.py**
  A command to render GXL_ format.

Requirements
============

Beyond the docutils_ package you may want to install the pygraphviz_
to render into dot_ output.

This runs on Python 2.7. Python 3 has not been tested.

Documentation
=============

See http://www.merten-home.de/FreeSoftware/rst2graph/manual.html or
use **--help** for options.

Tests
=====

There are test suites in ``tests.tgz``. Use filterunit_ to run tests.

Availability
============

**rst2graph** is available from

http://www.merten-home.de/FreeSoftware/rst2graph/

and the Docutils sandbox

http://svn.code.sf.net/p/docutils/code/trunk/sandbox/rst2graph

History
=======

**rst2graph** stems from **rst2gxl** which only supported the GXL_
format. Because the **gxl2gv** converter malfunctioned too often and
since pygraphviz_ is available **rst2gxl** became the foundation for
**rst2graph** supporting the dot_ format directly.
